art thou struck , and now pleased fortune does of marcus crassus\\' death make me revenger .\\nfor learn this , silius : better to leave undone than by our deed acquire too high a fame when him we serve\\'s away .\\ncaesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person .\\nwho does i\\' th\\' wars more than his captain can becomes his captain\\'s captain ; and ambition , the soldier\\'s virtue , rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him .\\ni could do more to do antonius good , but \\'twould offend him , and in his offense should my performance perish .\\nthou hast , ventidius , that without the which a soldier and his sword grants scarce distinction .\\nthou wilt write to antony ?\\ni\\'ll humbly signify what in his name , that magical word of war , we have effected : how with his banners and his well-paid ranks the ne\\'er-yet-beaten horse of parthia we have jaded out o\\' th\\' field .\\nwhere is he now ?\\nwhat , are the brothers parted ?\\nthey have dispatched with pompey ; he is gone .\\noctavia weeps to part from rome .\\ncaesar is sad , and lepidus , since pompey\\'s feast , as menas says , is troubled with the greensickness .\\na very fine one .\\noh , how he loves caesar !\\nnay , but how dearly he adores mark antony !\\ncaesar ?\\nwhat\\'s antony ?\\nthe god of jupiter .\\nspake you of caesar ?\\nhow , the nonpareil !\\no antony , o thou arabian bird !\\nwould you praise caesar , say \"caesar.\" go no further .\\nindeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .\\nbut he loves caesar best ; yet he loves antony .\\nhoo !\\nhearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , hoo ! , his love to antony .\\nboth he loves .\\nthey are his shards , and he\\nso , this is to horse .\\nadieu , noble agrippa .\\ngood fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .\\nno further , sir .\\nfor better might we have loved without this mean , if on both parts this be not cherished .\\nmake me not offended in your distrust .\\ni have said .\\nyou shall not find , though you be therein curious , the least cause for what you seem to fear .\\nso the gods keep you

.\\ntherefore , dear isis , keep decorum , and fortune him accordingly .\\nwhere is the fellow ?\\nhalf afeard to come .\\ngo to , go to. , come hither , sir .\\ngood majesty , herod of jewry dare not

enough .\\ni warrant you , madam .\\no my good lord , believe not all , or , if you must believe , stomach not all .\\na more unhappy lady , if this division chance , ne\\'er stood between , praying

hereafter .\\ntwill be naught , but let it be .\\nbring me to antony .\\ncome , sir .\\ncontemning rome , he has done all this and more in alexandria .\\nhere\\'s the manner of \\'t : i\\' th\\' marketplace , on a tribunal silvered , cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned .\\nthis in the public eye ?\\nshe in th\\' habiliments of the goddess isis that day appeared , and oft before gave audience , as \\'tis reported , so .\\nlet rome be thus informed .\\nwho , queasy with his insolence already , will their good thoughts call from him .\\nthe people knows it , and have now received his accusations .\\nwho does he accuse ?\\ncaesar , and that , having in sicily sextus pompeius spoiled , we had not rated him his part o\\' th\\' isle .\\nthen does he say he lent me some shipping , unrestored .\\nsir , this should be answered .\\ntis done already , and the messenger gone .\\ni have told him , lepidus was grown too cruel , that he his high authority abused and did deserve his change .\\nhe\\'ll never yield to that .\\nnor must not then be yielded to in this .\\nhail , caesar , and my lord !\\nhail , most dear caesar !\\nthat ever i should call thee castaway !\\nyou have not called me so , nor have you cause .\\nwhy have you stol\\'n upon us thus ?\\nyou come not like caesar\\'s sister .\\nthe wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear .\\nnay , the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven , raised by your populous troops .\\nwe should have met you by sea and land , supplying every stage with an augmented greeting .\\nmy lord , mark antony , hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted my grieved ear withal , whereon i begged his pardon for return .\\nwhich soon he granted , being an obstruct \\'tween his lust and him .\\namen .\\nhush !\\nhere comes antony .\\nsaw you my lord ?\\nno , lady .\\nwas he not here ?\\nno , madam .\\nhe was disposed to mirth , but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him. , enobarbus !\\nmadam ?\\nhere at your service .\\nmy lord approaches .\\nfulvia thy wife first came into the field .\\nagainst my brother lucius ?\\nay .\\ndo not say so , my lord .\\nwhere is he now ?\\nmy lord , in athens .\\nno , my most wronged sister .\\ncleopatra hath nodded him to her .\\nhe hath given his empire up to a whore ; who now

.\\nmy dear\\'st sister !\\nbut why , why , why ?\\nthou hast forspoke my being in these wars and sayst it is not fit .\\nis \\'t not denounced against us ?\\nwhy should not we be there in person ?\\nwhat is \\'t you say ?\\nsink rome !\\nand their tongues rot that speak against us !\\na charge we bear i\\' th\\' war , and as the president of my kingdom will appear there for a man .\\nspeak

and take in toryne ? , you have heard on \\'t , sweet ?\\ncelerity is never more admired than by the negligent .\\nby sea , what else ?\\nwhy will my lord do so ?\\nfor that he dares us to \\'t .\\nso hath my lord dared him to single fight .\\nay , and to wage this battle at pharsalia , where caesar fought with pompey .\\nbut these offers , which serve not for his vantage , he shakes off , and so should you .\\nin caesar\\'s fleet are those that often have \\'gainst pompey fought .\\ntheir ships are yare , yours , heavy .\\nno disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea , being prepared for land .\\ni\\'ll fight at sea .\\nbut if we fail , we then can do \\'t at land .\\nthy business ?\\nthe news is true , my lord .\\nhe is descried .\\ncanidius , our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , and our twelve thousand horse .\\nhow now , worthy soldier ?\\no noble emperor , do not fight by sea !\\ntrust not to rotten planks .\\ndo you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds ?\\nlet th\\' egyptians and the phoenicians go a-ducking .\\nwe have used to conquer standing on the earth and fighting foot to foot .\\nwell , well , away .\\nby hercules , i think i am i\\' th\\' right .\\nsoldier , thou art ; but his whole action grows not in the power on \\'t .\\nso our leader\\'s led , and we are women\\'s men .\\nyou keep by land the legions and the horse whole , do you not ?\\nmarcus octavius , marcus justeius , publicola , and caelius , are for sea ; but we keep whole by land .\\nthis speed of caesar\\'s carries beyond belief .\\nwhile he was yet in rome his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies .\\nwho\\'s his lieutenant , hear you ?\\nthey say , one taurus .\\nwell i know the man .\\nthe emperor calls canidius .\\nwith news the time\\'s with labor , and throws forth each minute some .\\ntaurus !\\nmy lord ?\\nstrike not by land ; keep whole .\\nprovoke not battle till we have done at sea .\\nour fortune lies upon this jump .\\nset we our

.\\nfare thee well awhile .\\ni never saw an action of such shame .\\nexperience , manhood , honor , ne\\'er before did violate so itself .\\nalack , alack !\\nour fortune on the sea is out of breath and sinks most lamentably .\\nhad our general been what he knew himself , it had gone well .\\noh , he has given example for our flight most grossly by his own !\\nay , are you thereabouts ?\\nwhy

.\\nfriends , begone .\\ni have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you .\\nbegone .\\noh , i followed that i blush to look upon !\\nmy very hairs do mutiny , for the white reprove the

dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness , who with half the bulk o\\' th\\' world played as i pleased , making and marring fortunes .\\nyou did know how much you were my conqueror , and that my sword , made weak by my affection , would obey it on all cause .\\nfall not a tear , i say .\\none of them rates all that is won and lost .\\ngive me a kiss .\\neven this repays me. , we sent our

myrtle leaf to his grand sea .\\nbe \\'t so .\\ndeclare thine office .\\nlord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and requires to live in egypt ; which not granted , he lessens his requests , and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth a private man in athens .\\nthis for him .\\nnext , cleopatra does confess thy greatness , submits her to thy might , and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs , now hazarded to thy grace .\\nfor antony , i have no ears to his request .\\nthe queen of audience nor desire shall fail , so she from egypt drive her all-disgraced friend or take his life there .\\nthis if she perform , she shall not sue unheard .\\nso to them both .\\nfortune pursue thee !\\nbring him through the bands .\\ncaesar , i go .\\nobserve how antony becomes his flaw , and what thou think\\'st his very action speaks in every power that moves .\\ncaesar , i shall .\\nwhat shall we do , enobarbus ?\\nthink and die .\\nis antony or we in fault for this ?\\nantony only , that would make his will lord of his reason .\\nwhy should he follow ?\\nthe itch of his affection should not then have nicked his captainship at such a point when half to half the world opposed , he being the mered question .\\ntwas a shame no less than was his loss , to course your flying flags and leave his navy gazing .\\nprithee , peace .\\nis that his answer ?\\nay , my lord .\\nthe queen shall then have courtesy , so she will yield us up ?\\nhe says so .\\nlet her know \\'t. , and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities .\\nthat head , my lord ?\\na messenger from caesar .\\nwhat , no more ceremony ?\\nsee , my women , against the blown rose may they stop their nose , that kneeled unto the buds. , admit him , sir .\\nat your noble pleasure .\\nhe stays upon your will .\\nwhat are you ?\\nfulvia thy wife is dead .\\nwhere died she ?\\nin sicyon .\\nher length of sickness , with what else more serious importeth

or needs not us .\\nif caesar please , our master will leap to be his friend .\\nfor us , you know whose he is we are , and that is caesar\\'s .\\nso. , thus then , thou most renowned : caesar entreats not to consider in what case thou stand\\'st , further than he is caesar .\\nhe knows that you embrace not antony as you did love , but as you feared him .\\noh !\\nhe is a god and knows what is most right .\\nmine honor was not yielded , but conquered merely .\\nshall i say to caesar what you require of him ?\\nfor he partly begs to be desired to give .\\nit much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon .\\nbut it would warm his spirits to hear from me you had left antony and put yourself under his shroud , the universal landlord .\\nwhat\\'s your name ?\\nmy name is thidias .\\nmost kind messenger , say to great caesar this in deputation : i kiss his conqu\\'ring hand .\\ntell him i am prompt to lay my crown at \\'s feet , and there to kneel

his face and whine aloud for mercy .\\ntake him hence .\\nthis jack of caesar\\'s shall bear us an errand to him .\\ngood my lord , you have been a boggler ever .\\nbut when we in our viciousness grow hard , oh , misery on \\'t ! , the wise gods seel our eyes , in our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us adore our errors , laugh at \\'s while we strut to our confusion .\\noh , is \\'t come to this ?\\ni found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar\\'s trencher .\\nnay , you were a fragment of gneius pompey\\'s , besides what hotter hours , unregistered in vulgar fame , you have luxuriously picked out .\\nfor i am sure , though you can guess what temperance should be , you know not what it is .\\nwherefore is this ?\\nsoundly , my lord .\\ncried he ?\\nand begged he pardon ?\\nhe did ask favor .\\nhave you done yet ?\\nalack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , and it portends alone the fall of antony .\\nto flatter caesar , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points ?\\nnot know me yet ?\\ncoldhearted toward me ?\\nah , dear , if i be so , from my cold heart let heaven engender hail , and poison it in the source , and the first stone drop in my neck .\\nas it determines , so dissolve my life !\\nthe next caesarion smite , till by degrees the memory of my womb , together with my brave egyptians all , by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey !\\ni am satisfied .\\ncaesar sits down in alexandria , where i will oppose his fate .\\nour force by land hath nobly held .\\nour severed navy too have knit again , and fleet , threat\\'ning most sealike .\\nwhere hast thou been , my heart ?\\ndost thou hear , lady ?\\nif from the field i shall return once more to kiss these

maliciously .\\nfor when mine hours were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives of me for jests ; but now i\\'ll set my teeth and send to darkness all that stop me .\\ncome , let\\'s have one other gaudy night .\\ncall to me all my sad captains .\\nlet\\'s mock the midnight bell .\\nit is my birthday .\\ni had thought t\\' have held it poor ; but since my lord is antony again , i will be cleopatra .\\nwe will yet do well .\\ndo so .\\nwe\\'ll speak to them , and tonight i\\'ll force the wine peep through their scars. , come on , my queen , there\\'s sap in \\'t yet .\\nnow he\\'ll outstare the lightning .\\nwhen valor preys on reason , it eats the sword it fights with .\\ni will seek some way to leave him .\\nhe calls me \"boy\" and chides as he had power to beat me out of egypt .\\nlet the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die , meantime laugh at his challenge .\\ngive him no breath , but now make boot of his distraction .\\nnever anger made good guard for itself .\\nlet our best heads know that tomorrow the last of many battles we mean to fight .\\nwithin our files there are , of those that served mark antony but late , enough to fetch him in .\\nsee it done and feast the army .\\nwe have store to do \\'t , and they have earned the waste .\\npoor antony !\\nwhat\\'s your pleasure , sir ?\\ni must with haste from hence .\\nwhy , then , we kill all our women .\\nwe see how mortal an unkindness is to them .\\nif they suffer our departure , death\\'s the word .\\ni must be gone .\\nunder a compelling occasion , let women die .\\nit were pity to cast them away for nothing , though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing .\\ncleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly .\\ni have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment .\\ni do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .\\nshe is cunning past man\\'s thought .\\nwe can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears .\\nhe will not fight with me , domitius ?\\nno .\\nwhy should he not ?\\nhe thinks , being twenty times of better fortune , he is twenty men to one .\\ntomorrow , soldier , by sea and land i\\'ll fight .\\nor i will live or bathe my dying honor in the blood shall make it live again .\\nwoo\\'t thou fight well ?\\ni\\'ll strike and cry , \"take

you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of cleopatra\\'s , which wholly depends on your abode .\\nno more light answers .\\nlet our officers have notice what we purpose .\\ni shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part .\\nfor not alone the death of fulvia , with more urgent touches , do strongly speak to us , but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home .\\nmuch is breeding which , like the courser\\'s hair , hath yet but life , and not a serpent\\'s poison .\\nsay our pleasure , to such whose place is under us , requires our quick remove from hence .\\ngo forth , agrippa , and begin the fight .\\nour will is antony be took alive .\\nmake it so known .\\ncaesar , i shall .\\nthe time of universal peace is near .\\ngo charge agrippa plant those that have revolted in the vant , that antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself .\\nfor this pains caesar hath hanged him .\\ncanidius and the rest that fell away have entertainment but no honorable trust .\\ni have done ill , of which i do accuse myself so sorely that i will joy no more .\\nenobarbus , antony hath after thee sent all thy treasure , with his bounty overplus .\\nthe messenger came on my guard , and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules .\\ni give it you .\\nmock not , enobarbus .\\ni tell you true .\\nbest you safed the bringer out of the host .\\ni must attend mine office , or would have done \\'t myself .\\nyour emperor continues still a jove .\\ni am alone the villain of the earth , and feel i am so most .\\no antony , thou mine of bounty , how wouldst thou have paid my better service , when my turpitude thou dost so crown with gold !\\nthis blows my heart .\\nif swift thought break it not , a swifter mean shall outstrike thought , but thought will do \\'t , i feel .\\ni fight against thee ?\\nno , i will go seek some ditch wherein to die .\\nthe foul\\'st best fits my latter part of life .\\nretire !\\nwe have engaged ourselves too far .\\ncaesar himself has work , and our oppression exceeds what we expected .\\no my brave emperor , this is fought indeed !\\nhad we done so at first , we had droven them home with clouts about their heads .\\nthou bleed\\'st apace .\\ni had a wound here that was like a \"t , \" but now \\'tis made an \"h.\" they do retire .\\nwe\\'ll beat \\'em into bench-holes .\\ni have yet room for six scotches more .\\nthey are beaten , sir , and our advantage serves for a fair victory .\\nlet us score their backs and snatch \\'em up , as we take hares , behind !\\ntis sport to maul a runner .\\ni will reward thee once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold for thy good valor .\\ncome thee on .\\ni\\'ll halt after .\\nwe have beat him to his camp .\\nrun one before and let the queen know of our gests .\\ntomorrow , before the sun shall see \\'s , we\\'ll spill the blood that has today escaped .\\nlord of lords !\\no infinite virtue , com\\'st thou smiling from the world\\'s great snare uncaught ?\\nmine nightingale , we have beat them to their beds .\\nwhat , girl , though gray do something mingle with our younger brown , yet ha\\' we a brain that nourishes our nerves and can get goal for goal of youth .\\nbehold this man .\\nhe hath fought today as if a god , in hate of mankind , had destroyed in such a shape .\\nhe has deserved it , were it carbuncled like holy phoebus\\' car .\\nif we be not relieved within this hour , we must return to th\\' court of guard .\\no bear me witness , night , what man is this ?\\nstand close and list him .\\nbe witness to me , o thou blessed moon , when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory , poor enobarbus did before thy face repent .\\nenobarbus ?\\npeace !\\nhark further .\\nthrow my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault , which , being dried with grief , will break to powder and finish all foul thoughts .\\no antony !\\nlet\\'s speak to him .\\nlet\\'s

.\\ncaesar , i shall .\\ngallus , go you along .\\nwhere\\'s dolabella , to second proculeius ?\\ndolabella !\\nlet him alone , for i remember now how he\\'s employed .\\nhe shall in time be ready .\\ngo with me and see what i can show in this .\\ntis paltry to be caesar .\\nnot being fortune , he\\'s but fortune\\'s knave , a minister of her will .\\ncaesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt

.\\nif he please to give me conquered egypt for my son , he gives me so much of mine own as i will kneel to him with thanks .\\nbe of good cheer .\\nyou\\'re fall\\'n into a princely hand .\\nfear

of languish ?\\ncleopatra , do not abuse my master\\'s bounty by th\\' undoing of yourself .\\nlet the world see his nobleness well acted , which your death will never let come forth .\\nwhere art

that i will not wait pinioned at your master\\'s court , nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia .\\nshall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome ?\\nrather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me .\\nrather on nilus\\' mud lay me stark naked and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring .\\nrather make my country\\'s high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains !\\nyou do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar .\\nproculeius , what thou hast done thy master caesar knows , and he hath sent for thee .\\nfor the queen , i\\'ll take her to my guard .\\nso , dolabella , it shall content me best .\\nbe gentle to her .\\nmost noble empress , you have heard of me ?\\ni can not tell .\\nyou laugh when boys or women tell their dreams .\\nis \\'t not your trick ?\\ni understand not , madam .\\ni dreamt there was an emperor antony .\\noh , such another sleep , that i might see but such another man !\\nhis reared arm crested the world .\\nfor his bounty , there was no winter in \\'t , an autumn \\'twas that grew the more by reaping .\\nin his livery walked crowns and crownets .\\nrealms and islands were as plates dropped from his pocket .\\ncleopatra , think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of ?\\ngentle madam , no .\\nyou lie up to the hearing of the gods .\\nnature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy , yet t\\' imagine an antony were nature\\'s piece \\'gainst fancy , condemning shadows quite .\\nhear me , good madam .\\nyour loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it as answering to the weight .\\nwould i might never o\\'ertake pursued success , but i do feel , by the rebound of yours , a grief that smites my very heart at root .\\ni thank you , sir .\\nknow you what caesar means to do with me ?\\ni am loath to tell you what i would you knew .\\narise , you shall not kneel .\\ni pray you , rise .\\nsir , the gods will have it thus .\\ntake to you no hard thoughts .\\ni\\'ll take my leave .\\nand may , through all the world !\\ntis yours , and we , your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall hang in what place you please .\\nhere , my good lord .\\nhow now , lady ?\\ni would i had thy inches .\\nthou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt .\\nhear me , queen : the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile , but my full heart remains in use with you .\\nour italy shines o\\'er with civil swords .\\nsextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome .\\nmy more particular , and that which most with you

myself nothing .\\nmadam , i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not .\\nwhat have i kept back ?\\nenough to purchase what you have made known .\\nnay , blush not , cleopatra .\\nsee , caesar !\\noh , behold how pomp is followed !\\nthe ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild .\\nthou shalt go back , i warrant thee !\\nbut i\\'ll catch thine eyes , though they

.\\nthe like is on her arm .\\nthis is an aspic\\'s trail , and these fig leaves have slime upon them , such as th\\' aspic leaves upon the caves of nile .\\ntake up her bed and bear her women from the monument .\\nshe shall be buried by her antony .\\nno grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous .\\nour army shall in solemn show attend this funeral , and then to rome .\\ncome , dolabella , see high order in this great solemnity .\\nyou\\'ll heat my blood .\\nno more .\\nyou can do better yet , but this is meetly .\\nnow , by my sword , and target .\\ni\\'ll leave you , lady .\\ncourteous lord , one word .\\nsir , you and i must part , but that\\'s not it .\\ntis sweating labor to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this .\\nbut , sir , forgive me , since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you .\\nyour honor calls you hence .\\ntherefore be deaf to my unpitied folly , and all the gods go with you !\\nupon your sword sit laurel victory , and smooth success be strewed before your feet .\\nlet us go .\\ncome .\\nour separation so abides and flies that thou , residing here , goes yet with me , and i , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .\\nyou are too indulgent .\\nsay this becomes him , as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things can not blemish , yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness .\\nif he filled his vacancy with his voluptuousness , full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him for \\'t .\\nhere\\'s more news .\\npompey is strong at sea , and it appears he is beloved of those that only have feared caesar .\\ni should have known no less .\\nit hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wished until he were , and the ebbed man , ne\\'er loved till ne\\'er worth love , comes deared by being lacked .\\ncaesar , i bring thee word menecrates and menas , famous pirates , make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound with keels of every kind .\\nmany hot inroads they make in italy , the borders maritime lack blood to think on \\'t , and flush youth revolt .\\nantony , leave thy lascivious wassails .\\nwhen thou once wast beaten from modena , where thou slew\\'st hirtius and pansa , consuls , at thy heel did famine follow , whom thou fought\\'st against , though daintily brought up , with patience more than savages could suffer .\\nthou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at .\\ntis pity of him .\\nlet his shames quickly drive him to rome .\\ntis time we twain did show ourselves i\\' th\\' field , and to that end assemble we immediate council .\\npompey thrives in our idleness .\\ntomorrow , caesar , i shall be furnished to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time .\\ntill which encounter it is my business too .\\nfarewell .\\nfarewell , my lord .\\ncharmian !\\nmadam ?\\nthat i might sleep out this great gap of time my antony is away .\\nyou think of him too much .\\noh , \\'tis treason !\\nmadam , i trust , not so .\\nwhat\\'s your highness\\' pleasure ?\\nnot now to hear thee sing .\\ni take no pleasure in aught an eunuch has .\\ntis well for thee that , being unseminared , thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of egypt .\\nhast thou affections ?\\nyes , gracious madam .\\nindeed ?\\nnot in deed , madam , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done .\\nstands he or sits he ?\\nor does he walk ?\\nor is he on his horse ?\\no happy horse , to bear the weight of antony !\\nhe\\'s speaking now , or murmuring \"where\\'s my serpent of old nile ? \" for so he calls me .\\nnow i feed myself with most delicious poison .\\nthink on me , that am with phoebus\\' amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time .\\nnay , hear them , antony .\\nperform \\'t , or else we damn thee.\" how , my love ?\\nperchance ?\\nnay , and most like .\\nyou must not stay here longer .\\ncall in the messengers .\\nas i am egypt\\'s queen , thou blushest , antony , and that blood of thine is caesar\\'s homager .\\nthe messengers !\\nsovereign of egypt , hail !\\nhow much unlike art thou mark antony !\\nyet , coming from him , that great med\\'cine hath with his tinct gilded thee .\\nhow goes it with my brave mark antony ?\\nlast thing he did , dear queen , he kissed , the last of many doubled kisses , this orient pearl .\\nmine ear must pluck it thence .\\ngood friend , \" quoth he , \"say the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , to mend the petty present , i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms .\\nall the east , say thou , shall call her mistress.\" so he nodded , and soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed , who neighed so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbed by him .\\nwhat was he , sad or merry ?\\nlike to the time o\\' th\\' year between the extremes of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .\\nnote him , note him , good charmian , \\'tis the man , but note him .\\nhe was not sad , for he would shine on those that make their looks by his .\\nhe was not merry , which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy , but between both .\\no heavenly mingle !\\nbe\\'st thou sad or merry , the violence of either thee becomes , so does it no man else. , mett\\'st thou my posts ?\\nay , madam , twenty several messengers .\\nwhy do you send so thick ?\\nwho\\'s born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar .\\nink and paper , charmian .\\nwelcome , my good alexas .\\ndid i , charmian , ever love caesar so ?\\noh , that brave caesar !\\nbe choked with such another emphasis !\\nsay , \"the brave antony.\" the valiant caesar !\\nby isis , i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men .\\nby your most gracious pardon , i sing but after you .\\nmy salad days , when i was green in judgment , cold in blood , to say as i said then .\\nwe , ignorant of ourselves , beg often our own harms , which the wise powers deny us for our good , so find we profit by losing of our prayers .\\ni shall do well .\\nthe people love me , and the sea is mine .\\nmy powers are crescent , and my auguring hope says it will come to th\\' full .\\nmark antony in egypt sits at dinner , and will make no wars without doors .\\ncaesar gets money where he loses hearts .\\nlepidus flatters both , of both is flattered , but he neither loves , nor either cares for him .\\ncaesar and lepidus are in the field .\\na mighty strength they carry .\\nwhere have you this ?\\ntis false .\\nfrom silvius , sir .\\nhe dreams .\\ni know they are in rome together looking for antony .\\nbut all the charms of love , salt cleopatra , soften thy wanned lip !\\nlet witchcraft join with beauty , lust with both .\\ntie up the libertine in a field of feasts , keep his brain fuming .\\nthis is most certain that i shall deliver : mark antony is every hour in rome expected .\\nsince he went from egypt \\'tis a space for farther travel .\\nhis soldiership is twice the other twain .\\nbut let us rear the higher our opinion , that our stirring can from the lap of egypt\\'s widow pluck the ne\\'er lust-wearied antony .\\ni can not hope caesar and antony shall well greet together .\\ni know not , menas , how lesser enmities may give way to greater .\\nbe \\'t as our gods will have \\'t .\\nit only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands .\\ncome , menas .\\ngood enobarbus , \\'tis a worthy deed , and shall become you well , to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech .\\ni shall entreat him to answer like himself .\\nby jupiter , were i the wearer of antonio\\'s beard , i would not shave \\'t today .\\ntis not a time for private stomaching .\\nbut small to greater matters must give way .\\nnot if the small come first .\\nhere comes the noble antony .\\nand yonder , caesar .\\ntis spoken well .\\nwere we before our armies , and to fight , i should do thus .\\nwelcome to rome .\\nthank you .\\nsit .\\nsit , sir .\\nnay , then .\\ni must be laughed at if or for nothing or a little , i should say myself offended , and with you chiefly i\\' th\\' world ; more laughed at , that i should once name you derogately , when to sound your name it not concerned me .\\nmy being in egypt , caesar , what was \\'t to you ?\\nno more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt .\\nyet if you there did practice on my state , your being in egypt might be my question .\\nhow intend you , \"practiced\" ?\\nyou may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me .\\nyour wife and brother made wars upon me , and their contestation was theme for you .\\nyou were the word of war .\\nyou do mistake your business .\\nmy brother never did urge me in his act .\\ndid he not rather discredit my authority with yours , and make the wars alike against my stomach , having alike your cause ?\\nof this my letters before did satisfy you .\\nif you\\'ll patch a quarrel , as matter whole you have to make it with , it must not be with this .\\nyou praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patched up your excuses .\\nnot so , not so .\\ni know you could not lack , i am certain on \\'t , very necessity of this thought , that i , your partner in the cause \\'gainst which he fought , could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace .\\nas for my wife , i would you had her spirit in such another .\\nthe third o\\' th\\' world is yours , which with a snaffle you may pace easy , but not such a wife .\\nfor that you must but say i could not help it .\\ni wrote to you when rioting in alexandria .\\nthree kings i had newly feasted , and did want of what i was i\\' th\\' morning .\\nbut next day i told him of myself , which was as much as to have asked him pardon .\\nlet this fellow be nothing of our strife .\\nhear the ambassadors .\\nno messenger but thine , and all alone tonight we\\'ll wander through the streets and note the qualities of people .\\nyou have broken the article of your oath , which you shall never have tongue to charge me with .\\nsoft , caesar .\\nno , lepidus , let him speak .\\nthe honor is sacred which he talks on now , supposing that i lacked it. , but , on , caesar .\\nthe article of my oath ?\\nto lend me arms and aid when i required them , the which you both denied .\\nneglected , rather , and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge .\\ntis noble spoken .\\nif it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye , to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you .\\nworthily spoken , maecenas .\\nor , if you borrow one another\\'s love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of pompey , return it again .\\nyou shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .\\nthou art a soldier only .\\ntherefore speak no more .\\ngo to , then .\\ngive me leave , caesar .\\nspeak , agrippa .\\nthou hast a sister by the mother\\'s side , admired octavia .\\ngreat mark antony is now a widower .\\nsay not so , agrippa .\\nif cleopatra heard you , your reproof were well deserved of rashness .\\ni am not married , caesar .\\nlet me hear agrippa further speak .\\nby this marriage , all little jealousies , which now seem great , and all great fears , which now import their dangers , would then be nothing .\\nher love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her .\\nwill caesar speak ?\\nthe power of caesar , and his power unto octavia .\\nmay i never to this good purpose , that so fairly shows , dream of impediment !\\nthere\\'s my hand .\\na sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly .\\nlet her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never fly off our loves again !\\nhappily , amen !\\ni did not think to draw my sword \\'gainst pompey , for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me .\\ntime calls upon \\'s .\\nof us must pompey presently be sought , or else he seeks out us .\\nwhere lies he ?\\nwhat is his strength by land ?\\ngreat and increasing .\\nbut by sea he is an absolute master .\\nso is the fame .\\nlet us , lepidus , not lack your company .\\nnoble antony , not sickness should detain me .\\ngood enobarbus !\\nwe have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .\\nyou stayed well by \\'t in egypt .\\neight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there !\\nis this true ?\\nthis was but as a fly by an eagle .\\nwe had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .\\nshe\\'s a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .\\ni will tell you .\\nthe poop was beaten gold , purple the sails , and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them .\\nthe oars were silver , which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made the water which they beat to follow faster , as amorous of their strokes .\\non each side her stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling cupids , with divers-colored fans , whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , and what they undid did .\\noh , rare for antony !\\nupon her landing , antony sent to her , invited her to supper .\\nshe replied it should be better he became her guest , which she entreated .\\nroyal wench !\\nnow antony must leave her utterly .\\nage can not wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety .\\nother women cloy the appetites they feed , but she makes hungry where most she satisfies , for vilest things become themselves in her , that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish .\\nlet us go .\\ngood enobarbus , make yourself my guest whilst you abide here .\\nhumbly , sir , i thank you .\\nall which time before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you .\\ngood night .\\nif you can , your reason ?\\nbut yet hie you to egypt again .\\nsay to me whose fortunes shall rise higher , caesar\\'s or mine ?\\ncaesar\\'s .\\ntherefore , o antony , stay not by his side .\\nthy daemon , that thy spirit which keeps thee , is noble , courageous , high , unmatchable where caesar\\'s is not .\\nbut near him thy angel becomes afeard , as being o\\'erpowered .\\ntherefore make space enough between you .\\nrest you happy !\\nspeak this no more .\\nto none but thee , no more but when to thee .\\nif thou dost play with him at any game , thou art sure to lose , and of that natural luck he beats thee \\'gainst the odds .\\nthy luster thickens when he shines by .\\ni will to egypt .\\nand though i make this marriage for my peace , i\\' th\\' east my pleasure lies .\\no come , ventidius .\\nyou must to parthia .\\nyour commission\\'s ready .\\nfollow me and receive \\'t .\\ntrouble yourselves no further .\\npray you , hasten your generals after .\\nsir , mark antony will e\\'en but kiss octavia , and we\\'ll follow .\\ntill i shall see you in your soldiers\\' dress , which will become you both , farewell .\\nyour way is shorter .\\nmy purposes do draw me much about .\\nyou\\'ll win two days upon me .\\nsir , good success .\\nfarewell .\\ngive me some music .\\nmusic , moody food of us that trade in love .\\nthe music , ho !\\nlet it alone .\\nlet\\'s to billiards .\\ncome , charmian .\\nmy arm is sore .\\nas well as i can , madam .\\ni\\'ll none now .\\ngive me mine angle .\\nwe\\'ll to th\\' river .\\nthere , my music playing far off , i will betray tawny-finned fishes .\\nram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears , that long time have been barren .\\nmadam , madam , antonio\\'s dead !\\nif thou say so , villain , thou kill\\'st thy mistress .\\nbut well and free , if thou so yield him , there is gold , and here my bluest veins to kiss , a hand that kings have lipped , and trembled kissing .\\nfirst , madam , he is well .\\nwhy , there\\'s more gold .\\nbut , sirrah , mark , we use to say the dead are well .\\nbring it to that , the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill-uttering throat .\\ngood madam , hear me .\\nwell , go to , i will .\\nbut there\\'s no goodness in thy face , if antony be free and healthful , so tart a favor to trumpet such good tidings !\\nif that you were the good sir rowland\\'s son , as you have whispered faithfully you were , and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limned and living in your face , be truly welcome hither .\\ni am the duke that loved your father .\\nthe residue of your fortune go to my cave and tell me. , good old man , thou art right welcome as thy master is .\\nsupport him by the arm .\\ngive me your hand , and let me all your fortunes understand .\\nnot see him since ?\\nsir , sir , that can not be .\\nbut were i not the better part made mercy , i should not seek an absent argument of my revenge , thou present .\\nbut look to it : find out thy brother , wheresoe\\'er he is .\\nbring him , dead or living , within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory .\\nthy lands and all things that thou dost call thine worth seizure , do we seize into our hands till thou canst quit thee by thy brother\\'s mouth of what we think against thee .\\noh , that your highness knew my heart in this : i never loved my brother in my life .\\nmore villain thou. , well , push him out of doors and let my officers of such a nature make an extent upon his house and lands .\\ndo this expediently , and turn him going .\\nhang there , my verse , in witness of my love .\\nand how like you this shepherd\\'s life , master touchstone ?\\ntruly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life ; but in respect that it is a shepherd\\'s life , it is naught .\\nin respect that it is solitary , i like it very well ; but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .\\nnow in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well ; but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .\\nhast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?\\nsuch a one is a natural philosopher .\\nwast ever in court , shepherd ?\\nno , truly .\\nthen thou art damned .\\nnay , i hope .\\nyour reason .\\nwhy , if thou never wast at court , thou never saw\\'st good manners ; if thou never saw\\'st good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .\\nthou art in a parlous state , shepherd .\\nnot a whit , touchstone .\\nthose that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .\\nyou told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands .\\nthat courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds .\\ninstance , briefly .\\ncome , instance .\\nwhy , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .\\nwhy , do not your courtier\\'s hands sweat ?\\nand is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?\\na better instance , i say .\\ncome .\\nbesides , our hands are hard .\\nyour lips will feel them the sooner .\\ncome .\\nmost shallow man .\\nthou worms \\' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh , indeed .\\nlearn of the wise and perpend : civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .\\nmend the instance , shepherd .\\nyou have too courtly a wit for me .\\ni\\'ll rest .\\ngood morrow to your worship .\\ncan you tell if rosalind , the duke\\'s daughter , be banished with her father ?\\nwhere will the old duke live ?\\nwilt thou rest damned ?\\ngod help thee , shallow man .\\ngod make incision in thee ; thou art raw .\\nthat is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle ; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .\\nhere comes young master ganymede , my new mistress\\'s brother .\\nno jewel is like rosalind .\\nher worth being mounted on the wind , through all the world bears rosalind .\\nall the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind .\\nlet no fair be kept in mind but the fair of rosalind .\\ni\\'ll rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted .\\nit is the right butter-women\\'s rank to market .\\nout , fool .\\nfor a taste : if a hart do lack a hind , let him seek out rosalind .\\nif the cat will after kind , so , be sure , will rosalind .\\nwinter garments must be lined , so must slender rosalind .\\nthey that reap must sheaf and bind , then to cart with rosalind .\\nsweetest nut hath sourest rind ; such a nut is rosalind .\\nhe that sweetest rose will find must find love\\'s prick , and rosalind .\\nthis is the very false gallop of verses .\\nwhy do you infect yourself with them ?\\npeace , you dull fool .\\ni found them on a tree .\\ntruly , the tree yields bad fruit .\\nyou have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .\\npeace .\\nbut upon the fairest boughs , or at every sentence end , will i \"rosalinda\" write , teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show .\\ntherefore heaven nature charged that one body should be filled with all graces wide-enlarged .\\nnature presently distilled helen\\'s cheek , but not her heart , cleopatra\\'s majesty , atalanta\\'s better part , sad lucretia\\'s modesty .\\nthus rosalind of many parts by heavenly synod was devised , of many faces , eyes , and hearts to have the touches dearest prized .\\nheaven would that she these gifts should have and i to live and die her slave .\\ndidst thou hear these verses ?\\noh , yes , i heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .\\nay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse , and therefore stood lamely in the verse .\\nbut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?\\nis it a man ?\\nand a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .\\nchange you color ?\\ni prithee , who ?\\no lord , lord , it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .\\nnay , but who is it ?\\nis it possible ?\\nnay , i prithee now , with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .\\no wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful , and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all whooping !\\ngood my complexion , dost thou think though i am caparisoned like a man , i have a doublet and hose in my disposition ?\\none inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery .\\ni prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .\\ni would thou couldst stammer , that thou might\\'st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .\\ni prithee take the cork out of thy mouth , that i may drink thy tidings .\\nso you may put a man in your belly .\\nis he of god\\'s making ?\\nwhat manner of man ?\\nis his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard ?\\nnay , he hath but a little beard .\\nwhy , god will send more , if the man will be thankful .\\nlet me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .\\nit is young orlando , that tripped up the wrestler\\'s heels and your heart both in an instant .\\nnay , but the devil take mocking .\\ni \\' faith , coz , \\'tis he .\\norlando ?\\norlando .\\nwhat did he when thou saw\\'st him ?\\nwhat said he ?\\nhow looked he ?\\nwherein went he ?\\nwhat makes him here ?\\ndid he ask for me ?\\nwhere remains he ?\\nhow parted he with thee ?\\nand when shalt thou see him again ?\\nanswer me in one word .\\nbut doth he know that i am in this forest and in man\\'s apparel ?\\nlooks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?\\nbut take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .\\ni found him under a tree like a dropped acorn .\\nit may well be called jove\\'s tree when it drops forth such fruit .\\ngive me audience , good madam .\\nproceed .\\nthere lay he , stretched along like a wounded knight .\\nthough it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .\\ncry \"holla\" to thy tongue , i prithee .\\nit curvets unseasonably .\\nhe was furnished like a hunter .\\noh , ominous !\\nhe comes to kill my heart .\\ni would sing my song without a burden .\\nthou bring\\'st me out of tune .\\ndo you not know i am a woman ?\\nwhen i think , i must speak .\\nsweet , say on .\\nyou bring me out .\\nsoft , comes he not here ?\\ntis he .\\ni thank you for your company , but , good faith , i had as lief have been myself alone .\\nand so had i , but yet , for fashion sake , i thank you too for your society .\\ngod be wi \\' you .\\nlet\\'s meet as little as we can .\\ni do desire we may be better strangers .\\ni pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks .\\ni pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly .\\nrosalind is your love\\'s name ?\\nyes , just .\\ni do not like her name .\\nwhat stature is she of ?\\njust as high as my heart .\\nyou are full of pretty answers .\\nthe worst fault you have is to be in love .\\ntis a fault i will not change for your best virtue .\\ni am weary of you .\\nthere i shall see mine own figure .\\nwhich i take to be either a fool or a cipher .\\ni\\'ll tarry no longer with you .\\nfarewell , good signior love .\\ni am glad of your departure .\\nadieu , good monsieur melancholy .\\nvery well .\\nwhat would you ?\\nyou should ask me what time o \\' day .\\nthere\\'s no clock in the forest .\\nthen there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .\\nmarry , do i , sir , and i came to acquaint you with a matter .\\ni am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .\\ntomorrow , sir , i wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .\\nyour brother is but young and tender , and , for your love i would be loath to foil him , as i must for my own honor if he come in .\\ntherefore , out of my love to you , i came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .\\ncharles , i thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite .\\ni had myself notice of my brother\\'s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it ; but he is resolute .\\ni\\'ll tell thee , charles : it is the stubbornest young fellow of france , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man\\'s good parts , a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother .\\ntherefore use thy discretion .\\ni had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .\\ni speak but brotherly of him , but should i anatomize him to thee as he is , i must blush and weep , and thou must look pale and wonder .\\nand why not the swift foot of time ?\\nhad not that been as proper ?\\nby no means , sir .\\ntime travels in diverse paces with diverse persons .\\ni\\'ll tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal , and who he stands still withal .\\ni prithee , who doth he trot withal ?\\nwho ambles time withal ?\\nthese time ambles withal .\\nwho doth he gallop withal ?\\nwho stays it still withal ?\\nwith lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term , and then they perceive not how time moves .\\nwhere dwell you , pretty youth ?\\nare you native of this place ?\\nas the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .\\nyour accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .\\ni have been told so of many .\\nbut indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .\\ni have heard him read many lectures against it , and i thank god i am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .\\ncan you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?\\nthere were none principal .\\ni prithee , recount some of them .\\nno , i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .\\nthere is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving \"rosalind\" on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of rosalind .\\ni am he that is so love-shaked .\\ni pray you tell me your remedy .\\nthere is none of my uncle\\'s marks upon you .\\nhe taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner .\\nwhat were his marks ?\\na lean cheek , which you have not ; a blue eye and sunken , which you have not ; an unquestionable spirit , which you have not ; a beard neglected , which you have not , but i pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother\\'s revenue .\\nthen your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied , and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation .\\nbut you are no such man .\\nyou are rather point-device in your accouterments , as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .\\nfair youth , i would i could make thee believe i love .\\nme believe it ?\\nbut , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired ?\\ni swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of rosalind , i am that he , that unfortunate he .\\nbut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?\\nneither rhyme nor reason can express how much .\\nlove is merely a madness and , i tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do , and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love , too .\\nyet i profess curing it by counsel .\\ndid you ever cure any so ?\\nyes , one , and in this manner .\\ni would not be cured , youth .\\ni would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .\\nnow , by the faith of my love , i will .\\ntell me where it is .\\ngo with me to it , and i\\'ll show it you ; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .\\nwill you go ?\\nwith all my heart , good youth .\\nnay , you must call me rosalind. , come , sister , will you go ?\\ncome apace , good audrey .\\ni will fetch up your goats , audrey .\\ndoth my simple feature content you ?\\nyour features , lord warrant us !\\nwhat features ?\\ntruly , i would the gods had made thee poetical .\\ni do not know what \"poetical\" is .\\nis it honest in deed and word ?\\nis it a true thing ?\\nno , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .\\ndo you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?\\ni do , truly , for thou swear\\'st to me thou art honest .\\nnow , if thou wert a poet , i might have some hope thou didst feign .\\nwould you not have me honest ?\\nno , truly , unless thou wert hard-favored , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .\\nwell , i am not fair , and therefore i pray the gods make me honest .\\ni am not a slut , though i thank the gods i am foul .\\nwell , praised be the gods for thy foulness ; sluttishness may come hereafter .\\nbut what though ?\\ncourage .\\nwell , that is the dowry of his wife ; \\'tis none of his own getting .\\nhorns ?\\neven so .\\npoor men alone ?\\nno , no .\\nthe noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .\\nis the single man therefore blessed ?\\nno .\\nas a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor .\\nhere comes sir oliver. , sir oliver martext , you are well met .\\nwill you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?\\nis there none here to give the woman ?\\ni will not take her on gift of any man .\\ntruly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .\\nhow do you , sir ?\\nyou are very well met .\\ngod \\'ild you for your last company .\\ni am very glad to see you .\\neven a toy in hand here , sir .\\nnay , pray be covered .\\nwill you be married , motley ?\\nas the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb , and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires ; and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .\\nand will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?\\nget you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is .\\nthen one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .\\ngo thou with me , and let me counsel thee .\\ncome , sweet audrey .\\nwe must be married , or we must live in bawdry. , farewell , good master oliver , not \\'t is no matter .\\nne\\'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .\\nnever talk to me .\\ni will weep .\\ndo , i prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .\\nbut have i not cause to weep ?\\nas good cause as one would desire .\\ntherefore weep .\\nand his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .\\ni am heartily glad i came hither to you .\\nif he come tomorrow , i\\'ll give him his payment .\\nif ever he go alone again , i\\'ll never wrestle for prize more .\\nfarewell , good charles .\\nbut it shall not be so long ; this wrestler shall clear all .\\nyou have heard him swear downright he was .\\nhe attends here in the forest on the duke your father .\\ni met the duke yesterday and had much question with him .\\nso he laughed and let me go .\\nbut what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando ?\\noh , that\\'s a brave man .\\nwho comes here ?\\nmistress and master , you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complained of love , who you saw sitting by me on the turf , praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress .\\nthe sight of lovers feedeth those in love .\\nsweet phoebe , do not scorn me .\\ndo not , phoebe .\\nsay that you love me not , but say not so in bitterness .\\nnow counterfeit to swoon , why , now fall down ; or if thou canst not , oh , for shame , for shame , lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers .\\nnow show the wound mine eye hath made in thee .\\nbut now mine eyes , which i have darted at thee , hurt thee not .\\nnor , i am sure , there is no force in eyes that can do hurt .\\no dear phoebe , if ever , as that ever may be near , you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , then shall you know the wounds invisible that love\\'s keen arrows make .\\nbut till that time come not thou near me .\\nand when that time comes , afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , as till that time i shall not pity thee .\\nbut , mistress , know yourself .\\ndown on your knees and thank heaven , fasting , for a good man\\'s love , for i must tell you friendly in your ear , sell when you can ; you are not for all markets .\\ncry the man mercy , love him , take his offer .\\nso take her to thee , shepherd .\\nbesides , i like you not .\\nwill you go , sister ? , shepherd , ply her hard .\\ncome , sister. , shepherdess , look on him better , and be not proud .\\nthough all the world could see , none could be so abused in sight as he .\\nsweet phoebe , pity me .\\nwhy , i am sorry for thee , gentle silvius .\\nif you do sorrow at my grief in love , by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermined .\\nthou hast my love .\\nis not that neighborly ?\\ni would have you .\\nwhy , that were covetousness .\\nbut do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employed .\\nknow\\'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?\\nnot very well , but i have met him oft , and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of .\\nthink not i love him , though i ask for him .\\ntis but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , but what care i for words ?\\nyet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear .\\nit is a pretty youth , not very pretty , but sure he\\'s proud , and yet his pride becomes him .\\nhe\\'ll make a proper man .\\nhe is not very tall , yet for his years he\\'s tall .\\nhis leg is but so-so , and yet \\'tis well .\\nthere was a pretty redness in his lip , a little riper and more lusty red than that mixed in his cheek : \\'twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask .\\nfor what had he to do to chide at me ?\\nhe said mine eyes were black and my hair black and , now i am remembered , scorned at me .\\ni marvel why i answered not again .\\nbut that\\'s all one : omittance is no quittance .\\ni\\'ll write to him a very taunting letter , and thou shalt bear it .\\nwilt thou , silvius ?\\nphoebe , with all my heart .\\ni will be bitter with him and passing short .\\ngo with me , silvius .\\ni prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .\\nthey say you are a melancholy fellow .\\ni am so .\\ni do love it better than laughing .\\nthose that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .\\nwhy , \\'tis good to be sad and say nothing .\\nwhy then , \\'tis good to be a post .\\ni have neither the scholar\\'s melancholy , which is emulation ; nor the musician\\'s , which is fantastical ; nor the courtier\\'s , which is proud ; nor the soldier\\'s , which is ambitious ; nor the lawyer\\'s , which is politic ; nor the lady\\'s , which is nice ; nor the lover\\'s , which is all these , but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness .\\na traveler .\\nby my faith , you have great reason to be sad .\\ni fear you have sold your own lands to see other men\\'s .\\nthen to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .\\nyes , i have gained my experience .\\nand your experience makes you sad .\\ni had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it , too .\\ngood day and happiness , dear rosalind .\\nmy fair rosalind , i come within an hour of my promise .\\ni pray thee , rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .\\ndear celia , i show more mirth than i am mistress of , and would you yet i were merrier ?\\nunless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .\\nherein i see thou lov\\'st me not with the full weight that i love thee .\\nwell , i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours .\\nby mine honor i will , and when i break that oath , let me turn monster .\\ntherefore , my sweet rose , my dear rose , be merry .\\nfrom henceforth i will , coz , and devise sports .\\nlet me see , what think you of falling in love ?\\nbreak an hour\\'s promise in love ?\\npardon me , dear rosalind .\\nnay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight .\\ni had as lief be wooed of a snail .\\nof a snail ?\\nbesides , he brings his destiny with him .\\nwhat\\'s that ?\\nwhy , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for .\\nbut he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .\\nvirtue is no hornmaker , and my rosalind is virtuous .\\nand i am your rosalind .\\nrosalind of a better leer than you .\\ncome , woo me , woo me , for now i am in a holiday humor , and like enough to consent .\\nwhat would you say to me now , an i were your very , very rosalind ?\\ni would kiss before i spoke .\\nnay , you were better speak first , and when you were graveled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss .\\nvery good orators , when they are out , they will spit ; and for lovers lacking , god warn us , matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .\\nhow if the kiss be denied ?\\nwho could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?\\nmarry , that should you if i were your mistress , or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit .\\nam not i your rosalind ?\\ni take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her .\\nno , faith , die by attorney .\\nthe poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicet , in a love cause .\\nthen love me , rosalind .\\nyes , faith , will i , fridays and saturdays and all .\\nand wilt thou have me ?\\nay , and twenty such .\\nwhat sayest thou ?\\nare you not good ?\\ni hope so .\\nwhy then , can one desire too much of a good thing ? , come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us. , give me your hand , orlando. , what do you say , sister ?\\npray thee , marry us .\\ni will .\\nay , but when ?\\nwhy , now , as fast as she can marry us .\\nthen you must say \"i take thee , rosalind , for wife.\" i take thee , rosalind , for wife .\\ni might ask you for your commission , but i do take thee , orlando , for my husband .\\nso do all thoughts .\\nthey are winged .\\nnow tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .\\nforever and a day .\\nsay \"a day\" without the \"ever.\" no , no , orlando , men are april when they woo , december when they wed. maids are may when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .\\ni will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock- pigeon over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more newfangled than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey .\\ni will weep for nothing , like diana in the fountain , and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry .\\ni will laugh like a hyena , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .\\nbut will my rosalind do so ?\\noh , but she is wise .\\nor else she could not have the wit to do this .\\nthe wiser , the waywarder .\\nmake the doors upon a woman\\'s wit , and it will out at the casement .\\nshut that , and \\'twill out at the keyhole .\\nstop that , \\'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney .\\na man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say \"wit , whither wilt ? \" nay , you might keep that check for it , till you met your wife\\'s wit going to your neighbor\\'s bed .\\nyou shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue .\\noh , that woman that can not make her fault her husband\\'s occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool .\\nfor these two hours , rosalind , i will leave thee .\\ni must attend the duke at dinner .\\nby two o\\'clock i will be with thee again .\\nay , go your ways , go your ways .\\ni knew what you would prove .\\nmy friends told me as much , and i thought no less .\\ntis but one cast away , and so , come , death .\\ntwo o\\'clock is your hour ?\\nay , sweet rosalind .\\ntherefore beware my censure , and keep your promise .\\nwith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind .\\nso , adieu .\\nwell , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try .\\nadieu .\\nyou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate .\\nwe must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .\\no coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love .\\nor rather bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .\\nno , that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen , and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone\\'s eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep i am in love .\\ni\\'ll tell thee , aliena , i can not be out of the sight of orlando .\\ni\\'ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .\\nand i\\'ll sleep .\\nwhich is he that killed the deer ?\\nyes , sir .\\nsing it .\\ntis no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .\\nhow say you now ?\\nis it not past two o\\'clock ?\\nand here much orlando .\\nlook who comes here .\\nno , i protest , i know not the contents .\\nphoebe did write it .\\nwhat shall be our sport , then ?\\nlet us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .\\nno ?\\nwhen nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by fortune fall into the fire ?\\nthough nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune , hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?\\ncome , come , you are a fool , and turned into the extremity of love .\\ni say she never did invent this letter .\\nthis is a man\\'s invention , and his hand .\\nsure it is hers .\\nwhy , she defies me like turk to christian .\\nwomen\\'s gentle brain could not drop forth such giant-rude invention , such ethiop words , blacker in their effect than in their countenance .\\nwill you hear the letter ?\\nso please you , for i never heard it yet , yet heard too much of phoebe\\'s cruelty .\\nshe phoebes me .\\nmark how the tyrant writes .\\nthat a maiden\\'s heart hath burned ?\\ncall you this railing ?\\nwhy , thy godhead laid apart , warr\\'st thou with a woman\\'s heart ?\\nnot to be endured .\\nit is no boast , being asked , to say we are .\\norlando doth commend him to you both , and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin .\\nare you he ?\\nsome of my shame , if you will know of me what man i am , and how , and why , and where this handkercher was stained .\\ni pray you , tell it .\\nhe threw his eye aside , and mark what object did present itself : under an old oak , whose boughs were mossed with age and high top bald with dry antiquity , a wretched , ragged man , o\\'ergrown with hair , lay sleeping on his back .\\nthis seen , orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother , his elder brother .\\noh , i have heard him speak of that same brother , and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men .\\nbut to orlando : did he leave him there , food to the sucked and hungry lioness ?\\ntwice did he turn his back and purposed so , but kindness , nobler ever than revenge , and nature , stronger than his just occasion , made him give battle to the lioness , who quickly fell before him ; in which hurtling , from miserable slumber i awaked .\\nare you his brother ?\\nwas \\'t you he rescued ?\\nwas \\'t you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?\\ntwas i , but \\'tis not i. i do not shame to tell you what i was , since my conversion so sweetly tastes , being the thing i am .\\nbut for the bloody napkin ?\\nby and by .\\nbrief , i recovered him , bound up his wound , and after some small space , being strong at heart ,\\nmany will swoon when they do look on blood .\\nthere is more in it. , cousin ganymede .\\nlook , he recovers .\\ni would i were at home .\\nwe\\'ll lead you thither .\\ni pray you , will you take him by the arm ?\\nbe of good cheer , youth .\\nyou a man ?\\nyou lack a man\\'s heart .\\ni do so , i confess it .\\nah , sirrah , a body would think this was well-counterfeited .\\ni pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited .\\nheigh-ho .\\nthis was not counterfeit .\\nthere is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest .\\ncounterfeit , i assure you .\\nwell then , take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man .\\nso i do .\\nbut i \\' faith , i should have been a woman by right .\\ncome , you look paler and paler .\\nthat will i , for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother , rosalind .\\ni shall devise something .\\nbut i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him .\\nwill you go ?\\nwe shall find a time , audrey .\\npatience , gentle audrey .\\nfaith , the priest was good enough , for all the old gentleman\\'s saying .\\na most wicked sir oliver , audrey , a most vile martext .\\nbut , audrey , there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you .\\nhere comes the man you mean .\\nit is meat and drink to me to see a clown .\\nhow old are you , friend ?\\nfive-and-twenty , sir .\\na ripe age .\\nis thy name william ?\\nwilliam , sir .\\na fair

yet it is not : it is but so-so .\\nart thou wise ?\\nay , sir , i have a pretty wit .\\nwhy , thou sayst well .\\ngive me your hand .\\nart thou learned ?\\nno , sir .\\nthen learn this of me : to have is to have .\\nfor it is a figure in rhetoric that drink , being poured out of a cup into a glass , by filling the one doth empty the other .\\nhe , sir , that must marry this woman .\\ntherefore , you clown , abandon , which is , in the vulgar , \"leave\" , the society , which in the boorish is \"company\" , of this female , which in the common is \"woman\" ; which together is , abandon the society of this female , or , clown , thou perishest ; or , to thy better understanding , diest ; or , to wit , i kill thee , make thee away , translate thy life into death , thy liberty into bondage .\\ni will deal in poison with thee , or in bastinado , or in steel .\\ni will bandy with thee in faction .\\ni will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways .\\ntherefore tremble and depart .\\ndo , good william .\\ngod rest you merry , sir .\\nour master and mistress seeks you .\\ncome away , away .\\ntrip , audrey , trip , audrey. , i attend , i attend .\\nmistress , you must come away to your father .\\nwere you made the messenger ?\\nof a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes , and swore by his honor the mustard was naught .\\nnow , i\\'ll stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .\\nhow prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge ?\\nay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .\\nstand you both forth now : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .\\nby our beards ( if we had them ) , thou art .\\nby my knavery ( if i had it ) , then i were .\\nis \\'t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?\\nit shall be to your good , for my father\\'s house and all the revenue that was old sir rowland\\'s will i estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .\\nyou have my consent .\\nlet your wedding be tomorrow .\\nthither will i invite the duke and all\\'s contented followers .\\ngo you and prepare aliena , for look you , here comes my rosalind .\\nand you , fair sister .\\no my dear orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf .\\nit is my arm .\\ni thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .\\nthey are in the very wrath of love , and they will together .\\nclubs can not part them .\\nthey shall be married tomorrow , and i will bid the duke to the nuptial .\\nbut oh , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man\\'s eyes .\\nby so much the more shall i tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness , by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .\\nwhy , then , tomorrow i can not serve your turn for rosalind ?\\ni can live no longer by thinking .\\ni will weary you then no longer with idle talking .\\ni speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch i say i know you are .\\nbelieve then , if you please , that i can do strange things .\\ni have , since i was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable .\\nif you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her .\\ni know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow , human as she is , and without any danger .\\nspeak\\'st thou in sober meanings ?\\nby my life i do , which i tender dearly , though i say i am a magician .\\nlook , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .\\ni care not if i have .\\nyou are there followed by a faithful shepherd .\\ngood shepherd , tell this youth what \\'tis to love .\\nit is to be all made of sighs and tears , and so am i for phoebe .\\nand i for ganymede

be all made of fantasy , all made of passion and all made of wishes , all adoration , duty , and observance , all humbleness , all patience and impatience , all purity , all trial , all observance , and so am i for phoebe .\\nand so am i for rosalind .\\nand so am i for no woman .\\nif this be so , why blame you me to love you ?\\nif this be so , why blame you me to love you ?\\nif this be so , why blame you me to love you ?\\nwhy do you speak , too , \"why blame you me to love you ? \" ?\\nto her that is not here , nor doth not hear .\\npray you , no more of this .\\ntis like the howling of irish wolves against the moon .\\ni\\'ll not fail , if i live .\\nnor i .\\nnor i .\\ntomorrow is the joyful day , audrey .\\ntomorrow will we be married .\\ni do desire it with all my heart , and i hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world .\\nhere comes two of the banished duke\\'s pages .\\nwell met , honest gentleman .\\nby my troth , well met .\\ncome , sit , sit , and a song .\\nwe are for you .\\nsit i \\' th \\' middle .\\nshall we clap into \\'t roundly , without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse , which are the only prologues to a bad voice ?\\ni \\' faith , i \\' faith , and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse .\\ntruly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untunable .\\ndost thou believe , orlando , that the boy can do all this that he hath promised ?\\nthat would i , had i kingdoms to give with her .\\nthat would i , were i of all kingdoms king .\\nthat will i , should i die the hour after .\\nbut if you do refuse to marry me , you\\'ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?\\nso is the bargain .\\nthough to have her and death were both one thing .\\ni have promised to make all this matter even .\\nkeep your word , phoebe , that you\\'ll marry me or else , refusing me , to wed this shepherd .\\nkeep your word , silvius , that you\\'ll marry her if she refuse me .\\nand from hence i go to make these doubts all even .\\ni do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter\\'s favor .\\nmy lord , the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter .\\nbut , my good lord , this boy is forest-born and hath been tutored in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle , whom he reports to be a great magician obscured in the circle of this forest .\\ngood my lord , bid him welcome .\\nthis is the motley-minded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest .\\nhe hath been a courtier , he swears .\\nif any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .\\ni have undone three tailors .\\ni have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .\\nand how was that ta\\'en up ?\\nfaith , we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .\\nhow \"seventh cause\" ? , good my lord , like this fellow .\\ni like him very well .\\nprithee , who is \\'t that thou mean\\'st ?\\none that old frederick , your father , loves .\\nmy father\\'s love is enough to honor him .\\nenough .\\nspeak no more of him ; you\\'ll be whipped for taxation one of these days .\\nthe more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .\\nwith his mouth full of news .\\nwhich he will put on us as pigeons feed their young .\\nthen shall we be news-crammed .\\nall the better .\\nwe shall be the more marketable. , bonjour , monsieur le beau .\\nwhat\\'s the news ?\\nfair princess , you have lost much good sport .\\nsport ?\\nof what color ?\\ngod \\'ild you , sir .\\na poor virgin , sir , an ill-favored thing , sir , but mine own .\\nby my faith , he is very swift and sententious .\\nbut for the seventh cause .\\nhow did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?\\nupon a lie seven times removed. , bear your body more seeming , audrey. , as thus , sir : i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier\\'s beard .\\nhe sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was .\\nthis is called \"the countercheck quarrelsome , \" and so to \"the lie circumstantial\" and \"the lie direct.\" and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?\\nhe\\'s as good at anything and yet a fool .\\nhe uses his folly like a stalking-horse , and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .\\nthen is there mirth in heaven when earthly things , made even , atone together .\\ngood duke , receive thy daughter .\\nhymen from heaven brought her , yea , brought her hither , that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within his bosom is .\\nif there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .\\nif there be truth in sight , you are my rosalind .\\nif sight and shape be true , why then , my love adieu .\\npeace , ho !\\no my dear niece , welcome thou art to me , even daughter , welcome in no less degree .\\nlet me have audience for a word or two .\\ni am the second son of old sir rowland , that bring these tidings to this fair assembly .\\nduke frederick , hearing how that every day men of great worth resorted to this forest , addressed a mighty power , which were on foot in his own conduct , purposely to take his brother here and put him to the sword .\\nthis to be true i do engage my life .\\nsir , by your patience : if i heard you rightly , the duke hath put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court .\\nhe hath .\\nto him will i .\\nout of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learned .\\nstay , jaques , stay .\\nto see no pastime i .\\nwhat you would have i\\'ll stay to know at your abandoned cave .\\nproceed , proceed .\\nwe\\'ll so begin these rites as we do trust they\\'ll end , in true delights .\\nif it be true that good wine needs no bush , \\'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue .\\nwhat color , madam ?\\nhow shall i answer you ?\\nas wit and fortune will .\\nyou tell us the manner of the wrestling .\\nwell , the beginning that is dead and buried .\\nthere comes an old man and his three sons , i could match this beginning with an old tale .\\nthree proper young men of excellent growth and presence .\\nwith bills on their necks : \"be it known unto all men by these presents.\" the eldest of the three wrestled with charles , the duke\\'s wrestler , which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him .\\nso he served the second , and so the third .\\nyonder they lie , the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .\\nalas !\\nbut what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?\\nwhy , this that i speak of .\\nor i , i promise thee .\\nbut is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?\\nshall we see this wrestling , cousin ?\\nyonder sure they are coming .\\nlet us now stay and see it .\\ncome on .\\nsince the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .\\nis yonder the man ?\\neven he , madam .\\nalas , he is too young .\\nyet he looks successfully .\\nhow now , daughter and cousin ?\\nare you crept hither to see the wrestling ?\\nay , my liege , so please you give us leave .\\nyou will take little delight in it , i can tell you , there is such odds in the man .\\nin pity of the challenger\\'s youth , i would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .\\ncall him hither , good monsieur le beau .\\nyonder comes my master , your brother .\\ngo apart , adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .\\nmonsieur the challenger , the princess calls for you .\\ni attend them with all respect and duty .\\nyoung man , have you challenged charles the wrestler ?\\nno , fair princess .\\nhe is the general challenger .\\ni come but in as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .\\nyoung gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .\\nyou have seen cruel proof of this man\\'s strength .\\nif you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .\\nwe pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .\\ndo , young sir .\\nbut let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial , wherein , if i be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious ; if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so .\\ni shall do my friends no wrong , for i have none to lament me ; the world no injury , for in it i have nothing .\\nonly in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty .\\nthe little strength that i have , i would it were with you .\\nand mine , to eke out hers .\\nfare you well .\\npray heaven i be deceived in you .\\nyour heart\\'s desires be with you .\\nyou shall try but one fall .\\nno , i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .\\ni would i were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .\\no excellent young man !\\nif i had a thunderbolt in mine eye , i can tell who should down .\\nno more , no more .\\nhow dost thou , charles ?\\nhe can not speak , my lord .\\nbear him away .\\nwhat is thy name , young man ?\\norlando , my liege , the youngest son of sir rowland de boys .\\ni would thou hadst been son to some man else .\\nthe world esteemed thy father honorable , but i did find him still mine enemy .\\ni would thou hadst told me of another father .\\nwere i my father , coz , would i do this ?\\ni am more proud to be sir rowland\\'s son , his youngest son , and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to frederick .\\nmy father loved sir rowland as his soul , and all the world was of my father\\'s mind .\\nhad i before known this young man his son , i should have given him tears unto entreaties ere he should thus have ventured .\\ngentle cousin , let us go thank him and encourage him .\\nshall we go , coz ?\\nay. , fare you well , fair gentleman .\\nhe calls us back .\\nwill you go , coz ?\\nhave with you .\\nfare you well .\\nwhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?\\ni can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .\\nor charles or something weaker masters thee .\\ngood sir , i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place .\\nalbeit you have deserved high commendation , true applause , and love , yet such is now the duke\\'s condition that he misconsters all that you have done .\\nthe duke is humorous .\\nbut i can tell you that of late this duke hath ta\\'en displeasure \\'gainst his gentle niece , grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father\\'s sake ; and , on my life , his malice \\'gainst the lady will suddenly break forth .\\nsir , fare you well .\\nhereafter , in a better world than this , i shall desire more love and knowledge of you .\\ni rest much bounden to you .\\nfare you well .\\nthus must i from the smoke into the smother , from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother .\\nbut heavenly rosalind !\\nwhy , rosalind !\\nnot one to throw at a dog .\\nno , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs .\\nthrow some of them at me .\\nthen there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .\\nbut is all this for your father ?\\nno , some of it is for my child\\'s father .\\nif we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .\\nhem them away .\\ni would try , if i could cry \"hem\" and have him .\\ncome , come , wrestle with thy affections .\\noh , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself .\\noh , a good wish upon you .\\nthe duke my father loved his father dearly .\\ndoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?\\nby this kind of chase i should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly .\\nyet i hate not orlando .\\nno , faith , hate him not , for my sake .\\nwhy should i not ?\\ndoth he not deserve well ?\\nlet me love him for that , and do you love him because i do .\\nlook , here comes the duke .\\nwith his eyes full of anger .\\nmistress , dispatch you with your safest haste , and get you from our court .\\nme , uncle ?\\nyou , cousin .\\nwithin these ten days if that thou beest found so near our public court as twenty miles , thou diest for it .\\ni do beseech your grace , let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me .\\nif with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires , if that i do not dream or be not frantic , as i do trust i am not , then , dear uncle , never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness .\\nthus do all traitors .\\nif their purgation did consist in words , they are as innocent as grace itself .\\nlet it suffice thee that i trust thee not .\\nthou art thy father\\'s daughter .\\nthere\\'s enough .\\nso was i when your highness took his dukedom .\\nso was i when your highness banished him .\\nmy father was no traitor .\\nthen , good my liege , mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous .\\ndear sovereign , hear me speak .\\nay , celia , we stayed her for your sake .\\ni was too young that time to value her , but now i know her .\\nif she be a traitor , why so am i .\\nthou art a fool .\\nshe robs thee of thy name , and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone .\\nthen open not thy lips .\\nfirm and irrevocable is my doom which i have passed upon her .\\nshe is banished .\\npronounce that sentence then on me , my liege .\\ni can not live out of her company .\\nyou are a fool. , you , niece , provide yourself .\\nif you outstay the time , upon mine honor and in the greatness of my word , you die .\\no my poor rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?\\nwilt thou change fathers ?\\ni will give thee mine .\\ni charge thee , be not thou more grieved than i am .\\ni have more cause .\\nnow , sir , what make you here ?\\nnothing .\\ni am not taught to make anything .\\nwhat mar you then , sir ?\\nmarry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .\\nshall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?\\nknow you where you are , sir ?\\no sir , very well : here in your orchard .\\nknow you before whom , sir ?\\nay , better than him i am before knows me .\\ni know you are my eldest brother , and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me .\\ni have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , i confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .\\nthou hast not , cousin .\\nprithee , be cheerful .\\nknow\\'st thou not the duke hath banished me , his daughter ?\\nthat he hath not .\\nno , hath not ?\\nrosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one .\\nshall we be sundered ?\\nshall we part , sweet girl ?\\nfor , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , say what thou canst , i\\'ll go along with thee .\\nwhy , whither shall we go ?\\nto seek my uncle in the forest of arden .\\nalas , what danger will it be to us , maids as we are , to travel forth so far ?\\nbeauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .\\ni\\'ll put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face .\\nwere it not better , because that i am more than common tall , that i did suit me all points like a man ?\\na gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh , a boar-spear in my hand , and in my heart lie there what hidden woman\\'s fear there will , we\\'ll have a swashing and a martial outside , as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances .\\nwhat shall i call thee when thou art a man ?\\ni\\'ll have no worse a name than jove\\'s own page , and therefore look you call me ganymede .\\nbut what will you be called ?\\nwould he not be a comfort to our travel ?\\nleave me alone to woo him .\\nlet\\'s away and get our jewels and our wealth together , devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight .\\nnow go we in content to liberty , and not to banishment .\\nnow , my co-mates and brothers in exile , hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp ?\\nare not these woods more free from peril than the envious court ?\\nthese are counselors that feelingly persuade me what i am.\" sweet are the uses of adversity , which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , wears yet a precious jewel in his head .\\nand this our life , exempt from public haunt , finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stones , and good in everything .\\ni would not change it .\\nhappy is your grace , that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style .\\ncome , shall we go and kill us venison ?\\nand indeed , my lord , the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting , and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase .\\nand did you leave him in this contemplation ?\\nwe did , my lord , weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer .\\nshow me the place .\\ni love to cope him in these sullen fits , for then he\\'s full of matter .\\ni\\'ll bring you to him straight .\\ncan it be possible that no man saw them ?\\nit can not be .\\nsome villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this .\\ni can not hear of any that did see her .\\nthe ladies , her attendants of her chamber saw her abed , and in the morning early they found the bed untreasured of their mistress .\\nmy lord , the roinish clown , at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh , is also missing .\\nsend to his brother .\\nfetch that gallant hither .\\nif he be absent , bring his brother to me .\\ni\\'ll make him find him .\\ndo this suddenly , and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways .\\nwho\\'s there ?\\nwhy , what make you here ?\\nwhy are you virtuous ?\\nwhy do people love you ?\\nand wherefore are you gentle , strong , and valiant ?\\nwhy would you be so fond to overcome the bonny prizer of the humorous duke ?\\nyour praise is come too swiftly home before you .\\nknow you not , master , to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?\\noh , what a world is this when what is comely envenoms him that bears it !\\nwhy , what\\'s the matter ?\\nwithin this roof the enemy of all your graces lives .\\nyour brother , no , no brother , yet the son , yet not the son , i will not call him son , of him i was about to call his father hath heard your praises , and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie , and you within it .\\nif he fail of that , he will have other means to cut you off .\\ni overheard him and his practices .\\nthis is no place , this house is but a butchery .\\nabhor it , fear it , do not enter it .\\nwhy , whither , adam , wouldst thou have me go ?\\nno matter whither , so you come not here .\\nwhat , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food , or with a base and boist\\'rous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road ?\\nyet this i will not do , do how i can .\\ni rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother .\\nbut do not so .\\nlet me be your servant .\\nthough i look old , yet i am strong and lusty , for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility .\\ntherefore my age is as a lusty winter , frosty but kindly .\\nlet me go with you .\\ni\\'ll do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities .\\no good old man , how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world , when service sweat for duty , not for meed .\\nbut come thy ways .\\nwe\\'ll go along together , and ere we have thy youthful wages spent , we\\'ll light upon some settled low content .\\nmaster , go on , and i will follow thee to the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .\\nfrom seventeen years till now almost fourscore here lived i , but now live here no more .\\nat seventeen years , many their fortunes seek , but at fourscore , it is too late a week .\\nyet fortune can not recompense me better than to die well , and not my master\\'s debtor .\\no jupiter , how weary are my spirits !\\ni care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .\\ni can not go no further .\\nfor my part , i had rather bear with you than bear you .\\nay , now am i in arden , the more fool i .\\nay , be so , good touchstone .\\nlook you who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .\\nwilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?\\ni am no villain .\\nwert thou not my brother , i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .\\nthou hast railed on thyself .\\nsweet masters , be patient .\\nfor your father\\'s remembrance , be at accord .\\nlet me go , i say .\\ni will not till i please .\\nyou shall hear me .\\nmy father charged you in his will to give me good education .\\nyou have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities .\\nthe spirit of my father grows strong in me , and i will no longer endure it .\\nand what wilt thou do , beg when that is spent ?\\nwell , sir , get you in .\\ni will not long be troubled with you .\\nyou shall have some part of your will .\\ni pray you leave me .\\nthat is the way to make her scorn you still .\\no corin , that thou knew\\'st how i do love her !\\ni partly guess , for i have loved ere now .\\nno , corin , being old , thou canst not guess , though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighed upon a midnight pillow .\\nbut if thy love were ever like to mine , as sure i think did never man love so , how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?\\ninto a thousand that i have forgotten .\\noh , thou didst then ne\\'er love so heartily .\\nif thou rememb\\'rest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into , thou hast not loved .\\nor if thou hast not sat as i do now , wearying thy hearer in thy mistress\\'s praise , thou hast not loved .\\nor if thou hast not broke from company abruptly , as my passion now makes me , thou hast not loved .\\no phoebe , phoebe , phoebe !\\nalas , poor shepherd , searching of thy wound , i have by hard adventure found mine own .\\nand i mine .\\ni remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to jane smile .\\nand i remember the kissing of her batler , and the cow\\'s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked .\\nand i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom i took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears , \"wear these for my sake.\" we that are true lovers run into strange capers .\\nbut as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .\\nthou speak\\'st wiser than thou art ware of .\\nnay , i shall ne\\'er be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it .\\njove , jove , this shepherd\\'s passion is much upon my fashion .\\nand mine , but it grows something stale with me .\\ni pray you , one of you question yond man , if he for gold will give us any food .\\npeace , fool .\\nhe\\'s not thy kinsman .\\nwho calls ?\\nyour betters , sir .\\ni prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment , bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .\\nfair sir , i pity her and wish , for her sake more than for mine own , my fortunes were more able to relieve her .\\nbut i am shepherd to another man and do not shear the fleeces that i graze .\\nbesides , his cote , his flocks , and bounds of feed are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , by reason of his absence , there is nothing that you will feed on .\\nwhat is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?\\nthat young swain that you saw here but erewhile , that little cares for buying anything .\\ni pray thee , if it stand with honesty , buy thou the cottage , pasture , and the flock , and thou shalt have to pay for it of us .\\nand we will mend thy wages .\\nassuredly the thing is to be sold .\\ngo with me .\\nif you like upon report the soil , the profit , and this kind of life , i will your very faithful feeder be and buy it with your gold right suddenly .\\nmore , more , i prithee , more .\\nit will make you melancholy , monsieur jaques .\\ni thank it .\\nmore , i prithee , more .\\ni can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs .\\nmore , i prithee , more .\\nmy voice is ragged .\\ni know i can not please you .\\ncome , more , another stanzo .\\nnay , i care not for their names .\\nwell then , if ever i thank any man , i\\'ll thank you .\\nbut that they call \"compliment\" is like th \\' encounter of two dog- apes .\\nwell , i\\'ll end the song. , sirs , cover the while ; the duke will drink under this tree. , he hath been all this day to look you .\\nand i have been all this day to avoid him .\\nhe is too disputable for my company .\\ni think of as many matters as he , but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .\\ncome , warble , come .\\ni\\'ll give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention .\\ndear master , i can go no further .\\noh , i die for food .\\nhere lie i down and measure out my grave .\\nfarewell , kind master .\\nwhy , how now , adam ?\\nno greater heart in thee ?\\nlive a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .\\nif this uncouth forest yield anything savage , i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .\\nthy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .\\ni will here be with thee presently , and if i bring thee not something to eat , i will give thee leave to die .\\nbut if thou diest before i come , thou art a mocker of my labor .\\nwell said .\\nthou look\\'st cheerly , and i\\'ll be with thee quickly .\\nyet thou liest in the bleak air .\\ncheerly , good adam .\\ni think he be transformed into a beast , for i can nowhere find him like a man .\\nmy lord , he is but even now gone hence .\\nhere was he merry , hearing of a song .\\nif he , compact of jars , grow musical , we shall have shortly discord in the spheres .\\ngo seek him .\\ntell him i would speak with him .\\nhe saves my labor by his own approach .\\nwhy , how now , monsieur ?\\nwhat a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company ?\\nwhat , you look merrily .\\nand then he drew a dial from his poke and , looking on it with lackluster eye , says very wisely , \"it is ten o\\'clock .\\nthus we may see , \" quoth he , \"how the world wags .\\ntis but an hour ago since it was nine , and after one hour more \\'twill be eleven .\\no noble fool !\\na worthy fool !\\nmotley\\'s the only wear .\\nwhat fool is this ?\\noh , that i were a fool !\\ngod be with my old master .\\nhe would not have spoke such a word .\\nis it even so ?\\nbegin you to grow upon me ?\\ni will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither. , holla , dennis !\\ncalls your worship ?\\nwas not charles , the duke\\'s wrestler , here to speak with me ?\\nso please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .\\ncall him in .\\ntwill be a good way , and tomorrow the wrestling is .\\ni must have liberty withal , as large a charter as the wind , to blow on whom i please , for so fools have .\\nand they that are most galled with my folly , they most must laugh .\\nand why , sir , must they so ?\\nthe \"why\" is plain as way to parish church : he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly , although he smart , not to seem senseless of the bob .\\ninvest me in my motley .\\ngive me leave to speak my mind , and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th \\' infected world , if they will patiently receive my medicine .\\nfie on thee !\\ni can tell what thou wouldst do .\\nwhat , for a counter , would i do but good ?\\nmost mischievous foul sin in chiding sin , for thou thyself hast been a libertine , as sensual as the brutish sting itself , and all th \\' embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .\\nwho can come in and say that i mean her , when such a one as she such is her neighbor ?\\nforbear , and eat no more .\\nwhy , i have eat none yet .\\nnor shalt not till necessity be served .\\nof what kind should this cock come of ?\\nart thou thus boldened , man , by thy distress or else a rude despiser of good manners , that in civility thou seem\\'st so empty ?\\nyou touched my vein at first .\\nbut forbear , i say .\\nan you will not be answered with reason , i must die .\\nwhat would you have ?\\nyour gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness .\\ni almost die for food , and let me have it .\\nsit down and feed , and welcome to our table .\\nspeak you so gently ?\\npardon me , i pray you .\\ni thought that all things had been savage here , and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment .\\ntrue is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolled to church , and sat at good men\\'s feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendered .\\nthen but forbear your food a little while whiles , like a doe , i go to find my fawn and give it food .\\nthere is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limped in pure love .\\ni thank you ; and be blessed for your good comfort .\\nthou seest we are not all alone unhappy .\\nall the world\\'s a stage , and all the men and women merely players .\\nthey have their exits and their entrances , and one man in his time plays many parts , his acts being seven ages .\\nat first the infant , mewling and puking in the nurse\\'s arms .\\nthen the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face , creeping like snail unwillingly to school .\\nand then the justice , in fair round belly with good capon lined , with eyes severe and beard of formal cut , full of wise saws and modern instances ; and so he plays his part .\\nwelcome .\\nset down your venerable burden , and let him feed .\\ni thank you most for him .\\nwelcome .\\nfall to .\\ni will not trouble you as yet to question you about your fortunes. , give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .\\nas if time were in debt .\\nhow fondly dost thou reason !\\nbear it straight , and bring thy master home immediately .\\nthere\\'s not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their well-acquainted friend , and every one doth call me by my name .\\nsome tender money to me ; some invite me ; some other give me thanks for kindnesses ; some offer me commodities to buy .\\neven now a tailor called me in his shop and showed me silks that he had bought for me , and therewithal took measure of my body .\\nsure , these are but imaginary wiles , and lapland sorcerers inhabit here .\\nmaster , here\\'s the gold you sent me for .\\nwhat adam dost thou mean ?\\nnot that adam that kept the paradise , but that adam that keeps the prison ; he that goes in the calf\\'s skin that was killed for the prodigal ; he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .\\ni understand thee not .\\nno ?\\nwhat , thou meanest an officer ?\\nay , sir , the sergeant of the band ; he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band ; one that thinks a man always going to bed and says \"god give you good rest.\" well , sir , there rest in your foolery .\\nis there any ships put forth tonight ?\\nmay we be gone ?\\nsome blessed power deliver us from hence !\\nwell met , well met , master antipholus .\\ni see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now .\\nis that the chain you promised me today ?\\nsatan , avoid !\\ni charge thee , tempt me not .\\nmaster , is this mistress satan ?\\nit is the devil .\\nnay , she is worse ; she is the devil\\'s dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench .\\nlight is an effect of fire , and fire will burn : ergo , light wenches will burn .\\nyour man and you are marvelous merry , sir .\\nwill you go with me ?\\nwe\\'ll mend our dinner here .\\nmaster , if you do , expect spoon meat ; or bespeak a long spoon .\\nwhy , dromio ?\\ni pray you , sir , my ring or else the chain .\\ni hope you do not mean to cheat me so .\\navaunt , thou witch ! , come , dromio , let us go .\\nmistress , that you know .\\nnow , out of doubt antipholus is mad ; else would he never so demean himself .\\na ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , and for the same he promised me a chain .\\nboth one and other he denies me now .\\nthe reason that i gather he is mad , besides this present instance of his rage , is a mad tale he told today at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance .\\nbelike his wife , acquainted with his fits , on purpose shut the doors against his way .\\nmy way is now to hie home to his house and tell his wife that , being lunatic , he rushed into my house and took perforce my ring away .\\nthis course i fittest choose , for forty ducats is too much to lose .\\nfive summers have i spent in farthest greece , roaming clean through the bounds of asia , and , coasting homeward , came to ephesus , hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbors men .\\nbut though thou art adjudged to the death , and passed sentence may not be recalled but to our honour\\'s great disparagement , yet will i favor thee in what i can .\\ntherefore , merchant , i\\'ll limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help .\\ni will , my lord .\\nfear me not , man .\\ni tell you , \\'twill sound harshly in her ears .\\nhere comes my man .\\ni think he brings the money .\\nhow now , sir ?\\nhave you that i sent you for ?\\nhere\\'s that , i warrant you , will pay them all .\\nbut where\\'s the money ?\\nwhy , sir , i gave the money for the rope .\\ni\\'ll serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .\\nto what end did i bid thee hie thee home ?\\nto a rope\\'s end , sir , and to that end am i returned .\\nand to that end , sir , i will welcome you .\\ngood sir , be patient .\\ngood now , hold thy tongue .\\nnay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .\\ni would i were senseless , sir , that i might not feel your blows .\\nthou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .\\ni am an ass , indeed ; you may prove it by my long ears. , i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .\\nnay , i bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat , and i think when he hath lamed me , i shall beg with it from door to door .\\ncome , go along .\\nmy wife is coming yonder .\\nmistress , wilt thou still talk ?\\nhow say you now ?\\nis not your husband mad ?\\nmark how he trembles in his ecstasy .\\ni conjure thee by all the saints in heaven .\\npeace , doting wizard , peace .\\ni am not mad .\\no , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !\\nyou minion , you , are these your customers ?\\ndid this companion with the saffron face revel and feast it at my house today whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house ?\\ndined at home\" ?\\nthou villain , what sayest thou ?\\nsir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .\\nwere not my doors locked up and i shut out ?\\nperdie , your doors were locked , and you shut out .\\nand did not she herself revile me there ?\\nsans fable , she herself reviled you there .\\ndid not her kitchen maid rail , taunt , and scorn me ?\\nand did not i in rage depart from thence ?\\nin verity you did. , my bones bear witness , that since have felt the vigour of his rage .\\nit is no shame .\\nalas , i sent you money to redeem you by dromio here , who came in haste for it .\\nmoney by me !\\nwent\\'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?\\nhe came to me , and i delivered it .\\nand i am witness with her that she did .\\ngod and the rope-maker bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope .\\nmistress , both man and master is possessed .\\ni know it by their pale and deadly looks .\\nthey must be bound and laid in some dark room .\\ni did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .\\nand , gentle master , i received no gold .\\nbut i confess , sir , that we were locked out .\\nlet him not come near me .\\nmore company !\\nthe fiend is strong within him .\\nwhat , will you murder me ? , thou jailer , thou , i am thy prisoner .\\nwilt thou suffer them to make a rescue ?\\nmasters , let him go .\\nhe is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .\\ngo , bind this man , for he is frantic too .\\nhe is my prisoner .\\nif i let him go , the debt he owes will be required of me .\\ni will discharge thee ere i go from thee .\\nbear me forthwith unto his creditor , and , knowing how the debt grows , i will pay it. , good master doctor , see him safe conveyed home to my house .\\no most unhappy day !\\no most unhappy strumpet !\\nmaster , i am here entered in bond for you .\\nhow idly do they talk !\\none angelo , a goldsmith .\\ndo you know him ?\\ni know the man .\\ntwo hundred ducats .\\nsay , how grows it due ?\\ndue for a chain your husband had of him .\\nhe did bespeak a chain for me but had it not .\\ni long to know the truth hereof at large .\\ngod for thy mercy , they are loose again !\\nand come with naked swords .\\nlet\\'s call more help to have them bound again .\\naway !\\nthey\\'ll kill us .\\ni see these witches are afraid of swords .\\nshe that would be your wife now ran from you .\\ni long that we were safe and sound aboard .\\nfaith , stay here this night .\\nthey will surely do us no harm .\\nyou saw they speak us fair , give us gold .\\nmethinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh\\nthat claims marriage of me , i could find in my heart to stay here still , and turn witch .\\ni will not stay tonight for all the town .\\ntherefore away , to get our stuff aboard .\\nhow is the man esteemed here in the city ?\\nhis word might bear my wealth at any time .\\nspeak softly .\\ntis so ; and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have .\\ngood sir , draw near to me .\\ntherefore give out you are of epidamnum , lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .\\nthere is your money that i had to keep .\\ngo bear it to the centaur , where we host , and stay there , dromio , till i come to thee .\\nwithin this hour it will be dinnertime .\\ntill that , i\\'ll view the manners of the town , peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , and then return and sleep within mine inn , for with long travel i am stiff and weary .\\nget thee away .\\nmany a man would take you at your word and go indeed , having so good a mean .\\na trusty villain , sir , that very oft , when i am dull with care and melancholy , lightens my humor with his merry jests .\\nwhat , will you walk with me about the town and then go to my inn and dine with me ?\\ni think i had .\\ni never did deny it .\\nyes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .\\nwho heard me to deny it or forswear it ?\\nthese ears of mine , thou know\\'st did hear thee .\\nfie on thee , wretch .\\ntis pity that thou liv\\'st to walk where any honest men resort .\\nthou art a villain to impeach me thus .\\ni\\'ll prove mine honor and mine honesty against thee presently if thou dar\\'st stand .\\ni dare , and do defy thee for a villain .\\nrun , master , run .\\nfor god\\'s sake , take a house .\\nthis is some priory .\\nin , or we are spoiled .\\nbe quiet , people .\\nwherefore throng you hither ?\\nto fetch my poor distracted husband hence .\\nlet us come in , that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery .\\nhow long hath this possession held the man ?\\nthis week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , and much different from the man he was .\\nbut till this afternoon his passion ne\\'er brake into extremity of rage .\\nhath not else his eye stray\\'d his affection in unlawful love , a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing ?\\nwhich of these sorrows is he subject to ?\\nyou should for that have reprehended him .\\nwhy , so i did .\\nay , but not rough enough .\\nhaply in private .\\nand in assemblies too .\\nay , but not enough .\\nalone , it was the subject of my theme ; in company i often glanced it .\\nstill did i tell him it was vile and bad .\\nand thereof came it that the man was mad .\\nthe venom clamors of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog\\'s tooth .\\nthou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .\\nthou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls .\\nin food , in sport , and life-preserving rest to be disturbed , would mad or man or beast .\\nthe consequence is , then , thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits .\\ngood people , enter and lay hold on him .\\nthen let your servants bring my husband forth .\\nit is a branch and parcel of mine oath , a charitable duty of my order .\\ntherefore depart and leave him here with me .\\nbe quiet and depart .\\nthou shalt not have him .\\ncomplain unto the duke of this indignity .\\ncome , go .\\ni will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess .\\nby this , i think , the dial points at five .\\nto see a reverend syracusian merchant , who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town , beheaded publicly for his offense .\\nsee where they come .\\nwe will behold his death .\\nkneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .\\nyet once again proclaim it publicly , if any friend will pay the sum for him , he shall not die ; so much we tender him .\\njustice , most sacred duke , against the abbess .\\nshe is a virtuous and a reverend lady .\\nit can not be that she hath done thee wrong .\\ntherefore , most gracious duke , with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .\\nlong since thy husband served me in my wars , and i to thee engaged a prince\\'s word , when thou didst make him master of thy bed , to do him all the grace and good i could .\\npeace , fool .\\nthy master and his man are here , and that is false thou dost report to us .\\nmistress , upon my life i tell you true .\\ni have not breathed almost since i did see it .\\nhe cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , to scorch your face and to disfigure you .\\nay me , it is my husband .\\nwitness you that he is borne about invisible .\\neven now we housed him in the abbey here , and now he\\'s there , past thought of human reason .\\neven for the blood that then i lost for thee , now grant me justice .\\nbeyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me .\\nthis day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me while she with harlots feasted in my house .\\na grievous fault. , say , woman , didst thou so ?\\nno , my good lord .\\nmyself , he , and my sister today did dine together .\\nso befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal .\\nne\\'er may i look on day , nor sleep on night but she tells to your highness simple truth .\\no perjured woman !\\nmy liege , i am advised what i say , neither disturbed with the effect of wine , nor heady-rash , provoked with raging ire , albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .\\nthat goldsmith there , were he not packed with her , could witness it , for he was with me then , who parted with me to go fetch a chain , promising to bring it to the porpentine , where balthasar and i did dine together .\\nour dinner done and he not coming thither , i went to seek him .\\nin the street i met him , and in his company that gentleman .\\nby th \\' way we met my wife , her sister , and a rabble more of vile confederates .\\nalong with them they brought one pinch , a hungry , lean-faced villain , a mere anatomy , a mountebank , a threadbare juggler , and a fortune-teller , a needy , hollow-eyed , sharp-looking wretch , a living dead man .\\nthis pernicious slave , forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , and , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse ,\\nbut had he such a chain of thee or no ?\\nhe had , my lord , and when he ran in here , these people saw the chain about his neck .\\ni never saw the chain , so help me heaven , and this is false you burden me withal .\\nwhy , what an intricate impeach is this !\\nsoon at five o\\'clock , please you , i\\'ll meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till bedtime .\\nmy present business calls me from you now .\\nfarewell till then .\\ni will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city .\\nsir , i commend you to your own content .\\nhe that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i can not get .\\ni to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop , who , falling there to find his fellow forth , unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself .\\nso i , to find a mother and a brother , in quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .\\nhow chance thou art returned so soon ?\\nreturned so soon ?\\nrather approach\\'d too late !\\nthe capon burns ; the pig falls from the spit ; the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell ; my mistress made it one upon my cheek .\\nyou say he dined at home ; the goldsmith here denies that saying .\\nsir , he dined with her there , at the porpentine .\\nhe did , and from my finger snatched that ring .\\ntis true , my liege ; this ring i had of her .\\nsaw\\'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?\\nas sure , my liege , as i do see your grace .\\ni think you are all mated or stark mad .\\nmost mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word .\\nhaply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me .\\nwithin this hour i was his bondman sir , but he , i thank him , gnawed in two my cords .\\nnow am i dromio , and his man , unbound .\\ni am sure you both of you remember me .\\nyou are not pinch\\'s patient , are you , sir ?\\nwhy look you strange on me ?\\nyou know me well .\\ni never saw you in my life till now .\\no , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , and careful hours with time\\'s deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face .\\nbut tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?\\nneither .\\ndromio , nor thou ?\\nno , trust me , sir , nor i. i am sure thou dost .\\nnot know my voice !\\no time\\'s extremity , hast thou so crack\\'d and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?\\nthough now this grained face of mine be hid in sap-consuming winter\\'s drizzled snow , and all the conduits of my blood froze up , yet hath my night of life some memory , my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , my dull deaf ears a little use to hear .\\nall these old witnesses , i can not err , tell me thou art my son antipholus .\\ni never saw my father in my life .\\nbut seven years since , in syracusa , boy , thou know\\'st we parted .\\ni see thy age and dangers make thee dote .\\nmost mighty duke , behold a man much wronged .\\ni see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .\\ni , sir , am dromio .\\ncommand him away .\\ni , sir , am dromio .\\nplease , let me stay .\\no , my old master. , who hath bound him here ?\\nwhoever bound him , i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty. , speak , old egeon , if thou be\\'st the man that hadst a wife once called emilia , that bore thee at a burden two fair sons .\\no , if thou be\\'st the same egeon , speak , and speak unto the same emilia .\\nwhy , here begins his morning story right ; these two antipholuses , these two so like , and these two dromios , one in semblance , besides her urging of her wreck at sea , these are the parents to these children , which accidentally are met together .\\nif i dream not , thou art emilia .\\nif thou art she , tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft ?\\ncorinth first .\\nstay , stand apart .\\ni know not which is which .\\ni came from corinth , my most gracious lord .\\nand i with him .\\nbrought to this town by that most famous warrior duke menaphon , your most renowned uncle .\\nwhich of you two did dine with me today ?\\ni , gentle mistress .\\nand are not you my husband ?\\nthat is the chain , sir , which you had of me .\\ni think it be , sir .\\ni deny it not .\\nand you , sir , for this chain arrested me .\\ni think i did , sir .\\ni deny it not .\\ni sent you money , sir , to be your bail by dromio , but i think he brought it not .\\nno , none by me .\\nthis purse of ducats i received from you , and dromio my man did bring them me .\\nthese ducats pawn i for my father here .\\nit shall not need .\\nthy father hath his life .\\nsir , i must have that diamond from you .\\nthere , take it ; and much thanks for my good cheer .\\nrenowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes , and all that are assembled in this place that by this sympathized one day\\'s error have suffered wrong .\\ngo , keep us company , and we shall make full satisfaction. , thirty-three years have i but gone in travail of you , my sons , and till this present hour my heavy burden ne\\'er delivered. , the duke , my husband , and my children both , and you , the calendars of their nativity , go to a gossips \\' feast , and go with me .\\nafter so long grief , such nativity !\\nwith all my heart i\\'ll gossip at this feast .\\ndromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embarked ?\\nyour goods that lay at host , sir , in the centaur .\\nhe speaks to me. , i am your master , dromio .\\nthere is a fat friend at your master\\'s house that kitchened me for you today at dinner .\\nshe now shall be my sister , not my wife .\\nmethinks you are my glass , and not my brother : i see by you i am a sweet-faced youth .\\nwill you walk in to see their gossiping ?\\nnot i , sir .\\nyou are my elder .\\nthat\\'s a question .\\nhow shall we try it ?\\nwe\\'ll draw cuts for the signior .\\ntill then , lead thou first .\\nnay , then , thus : we came into the world like brother and brother , and now let\\'s go hand in hand , not one before another .\\nstop in your wind , sir .\\ntell me this , i pray : where have you left the money that i gave you ?\\no , sixpence , that i had o \\' wednesday last to pay the saddler for my mistress \\' crupper ?\\nthe saddler had it , sir ; i kept it not .\\ni am not in a sportive humor now .\\ntell me , and dally not : where is the money ?\\nwe being strangers here , how dar\\'st thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody ?\\ni pray you , jest , sir , as you sit at dinner .\\nmethinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , and strike you home without a messenger .\\ncome , dromio , come , these jests are out of season .\\nreserve them till a merrier hour than this .\\nwhere is the gold i gave in charge to thee ?\\nto me , sir ?\\nwhy , you gave no gold to me !\\ncome on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .\\nmy charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house , the phoenix , sir , to dinner .\\nmy mistress and her sister stays for you .\\nnow , as i am a christian , answer me in what safe place you have bestowed my money , or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed .\\nwhere is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?\\nthy mistress \\' marks ?\\nwhat mistress , slave , hast thou ?\\nwhat , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , being forbid ?\\nthere , take you that , sir knave .\\nwhat mean you , sir ?\\nfor god\\'s sake , hold your hands .\\nnay , an you will not , sir , i\\'ll take my heels .\\nupon my life , by some device or other the villain is o\\'erraught of all my money .\\nthey say this town is full of cozenage , as nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , dark-working sorcerers that change the mind , soul-killing witches that deform the body , disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , and many suchlike liberties of sin .\\nneither my husband nor the slave returned that in such haste i sent to seek his master ?\\nsure , luciana , it is two o\\'clock .\\nperhaps some merchant hath invited him , and from the mart he\\'s somewhere gone to dinner .\\ngood sister , let us dine and never fret .\\na man is master of his liberty ; time is their master , and when they see time they\\'ll go or come .\\nif so , be patient , sister .\\nwhy should their liberty than ours be more ?\\nbecause their business still lies out o \\' door .\\nwhy , headstrong liberty is lashed with woe .\\nthen let your will attend on their accords .\\nthis servitude makes you to keep unwed .\\nnot this , but troubles of the marriage bed .\\nbut , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .\\nere i learn love , i\\'ll practice to obey .\\nhow if your husband start some otherwhere ?\\ntill he come home again , i would forbear .\\npatience unmoved !\\nno marvel though she pause ; they can be meek that have no other cause .\\na wretched soul , bruised with adversity we bid be quiet when we hear it cry , but were we burdened with like weight of pain , as much or more we should ourselves complain .\\nso thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , with urging helpless patience would relieve me ; but , if thou live to see like right bereft , this fool-begged patience in thee will be left .\\nwell , i will marry one day , but to try .\\nsay , is your tardy master now at hand ?\\nknow\\'st thou his mind ?\\nbut say , i prithee , is he coming home ?\\nit seems he hath great care to please his wife .\\nwhy , mistress , sure my master is horn mad .\\nhorn mad , thou villain !\\ni mean not cuckold mad , but sure he is stark mad .\\nmy mistress , sir , \" quoth i .\\nhang up thy mistress !\\nquoth my master .\\ni know , \" quoth he , \"no house , no wife , no mistress.\" so that my errand , due unto my tongue , i thank him , i bare home upon my shoulders , for , in conclusion , he did beat me there .\\ngo back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .\\ngo back again and be new beaten home ?\\nfor god\\'s sake , send some other messenger .\\nback , slave , or i will break thy pate across .\\nhence , prating peasant !\\nfetch thy master home .\\nyou spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither .\\nif i last in this service , you must case me in leather .\\nfie , how impatience loureth in your face .\\nhis company must do his minions grace , whilst i at home starve for a merry look .\\nhath homely age th \\' alluring beauty took from my poor cheek ?\\nbarren my wit ?\\nmy decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair .\\nbut , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale and feeds from home .\\npoor i am but his stale .\\nself-harming jealousy , fie , beat it hence .\\ni know his eye doth homage otherwhere , or else what lets it but he would be here ?\\nsister , you know he promised me a chain .\\nwould that alone o \\' love he would detain , so he would keep fair quarter with his bed .\\ni see the jewel best enameled will lose his beauty .\\nyet the gold bides still that others touch , and often touching will wear gold ; yet no man that hath a name by falsehood and corruption doth it shame .\\nsince that my beauty can not please his eye , i\\'ll weep what\\'s left away , and weeping die .\\nhow many fond fools serve mad jealousy !\\nproceed , solinus , to procure my fall , and by the doom of death end woes and all .\\nfor , since the mortal and intestine jars \\'twixt thy seditious countrymen and us , it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves , to admit no traffic to our adverse towns .\\nnay , more , if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs ; again , if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus , he dies , his goods confiscate to the duke\\'s dispose , unless a thousand marks be levied to quit the penalty and to ransom him .\\nthy substance , valued at the highest rate , can not amount unto a hundred marks ; therefore by law thou art condemned to die .\\nthe gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur , and the heedful slave is wandered forth , in care to seek me out .\\nby computation and mine host\\'s report , i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart .\\nsee , here he comes .\\nhow now , sir ?\\nis your merry humor altered ?\\nyou know no centaur ?\\nyou received no gold ?\\nyour mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?\\nmy house was at the phoenix ?\\nwast thou mad , that thus so madly thou didst answer me ?\\nwhat answer , sir ?\\nwhen spake i such a word ?\\ni did not see you since you sent me hence , home to the centaur with the gold you gave me .\\nvillain , thou didst deny the gold\\'s receipt and told\\'st me of a mistress and a dinner , for which , i hope , thou felt\\'st i was displeased .\\ni am glad to see you in this merry vein .\\nwhat means this jest ?\\ni pray you , master , tell me ?\\nyea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?\\nthink\\'st thou i jest ?\\nhold , take thou that and that .\\nhold , sir , for god\\'s sake !\\nnow your jest is earnest .\\nupon what bargain do you give it me ?\\nbecause that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you , your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours .\\nsconce\" call you it ?\\nshall i tell you why ?\\nwell , sir , i thank you .\\nmarry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .\\ni\\'ll make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .\\nbut say , sir , is it dinnertime ?\\nin good time , sir , what\\'s that ?\\nbasting .\\nwell , sir , then \\'twill be dry .\\nif it be , sir , i pray you , eat none of it .\\nyour reason ?\\nlest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .\\nwell , sir , learn to jest in good time .\\nthere\\'s a time for all things .\\ni durst have denied that before you were so choleric .\\nby what rule , sir ?\\nmarry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself .\\nlet\\'s hear it .\\nthere\\'s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .\\nwhy is time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?\\nwhy , but there\\'s many a man hath more hair than wit .\\nwhy , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .\\nfor what reason ?\\nfor two , and sound ones too .\\nnay , not sound , i pray you .\\nsure ones , then .\\nnay , not sure , in a thing falsing .\\ncertain ones , then .\\nname them .\\nthe one , to save the money that he spends in tiring ; the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .\\nyou would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .\\nthus i mend it : time himself is bald and therefore , to the world\\'s end , will have bald followers .\\nthe time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear , that never object pleasing in thine eye , that never touch well welcome to thy hand , that never meat sweet-savored in thy taste , unless i spake , or looked , or touched , or carved to thee .\\nhow comes it now , my husband , o , how comes it that thou art thus estranged from thyself ?\\nah , do not tear away thyself from me !\\ni know you not .\\nwhen were you wont to use my sister thus ?\\nshe sent for you by dromio home to dinner .\\nby dromio ?\\nby thee ; and this thou didst return from him : that he did buffet thee and , in his blows , denied my house for his , me for his wife .\\ndid you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?\\nwhat is the course and drift of your compact ?\\ni , sir ?\\ni never saw her till this time .\\nvillain , thou liest ; for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart .\\ni never spake with her in all my life .\\nwhat , was i married to her in my dream ?\\nor sleep i now and think i hear all this ?\\nwhat error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?\\nuntil i know this sure uncertainty i\\'ll entertain the offered fallacy .\\ndromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .\\no , for my beads !\\ni cross me for a sinner .\\nthis is the fairy land .\\no spite of spites !\\nwe talk with goblins , owls , and sprites : if we obey them not , this will ensue : they\\'ll suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .\\nwhy prat\\'st thou to thyself and answer\\'st not ?\\ndromio , thou , dromio , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot .\\ni am transformed , master , am i not ?\\ni think thou art in mind , and so am i. nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .\\ntis true .\\ni am an ass ; else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me .\\ncome , come , no longer will i be a fool , to put the finger in the eye and weep whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .\\ncome , sir , to dinner. , dromio , keep the gate .\\nhusband , i\\'ll dine above with you today , and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .\\nam i in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?\\nknown unto these , and to myself disguised !\\nmaster , shall i be porter at the gate ?\\nay ; and let none enter , lest i break your pate .\\nwell , syracusian , say in brief the cause why thou dep-artedst from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus .\\nin syracusa was i born , and wed unto a woman happy but for me , and by me , had not our hap been bad .\\nthat very hour , and in the selfsame inn , a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden , male twins , both alike .\\nunwilling , i agreed .\\nalas , too soon we came aboard .\\ngood signior angelo , you must excuse us all ; my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours .\\nsay that i lingered with you at your shop to see the making of her carcanet , and that tomorrow you will bring it home .\\nbut here\\'s a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart , and that i beat him and charged him with a thousand marks in gold , and that i did deny my wife and house. , thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?\\nsay what you will , sir , but i know what i know .\\ni think thou art an ass .\\nyou\\'re sad , signior balthasar .\\ni hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .\\ngood meat , sir , is common ; that every churl affords .\\nand welcome more common , for that\\'s nothing but words .\\nsmall cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .\\nay , to a niggardly host and more sparing guest .\\nbut though my cates be mean , take them in good part .\\nbetter cheer may you have , but not with better heart .\\nbut soft !\\nmy door is lock\\'d .\\nmaud , bridget , marian , ciceley , gillian , ginn !\\nmy master stays in the street .\\nwho talks within there ?\\nho , open the door .\\nwherefore ?\\nfor my dinner .\\ni have not dined today .\\nwhat art thou that keep\\'st me out from the house i owe ?\\no villain , thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !\\no lord , i must laugh .\\nhave at you with a proverb : shall i set in my staff ?\\ndo you hear , you minion ?\\nyou\\'ll let us in , i hope ?\\nso , come , help .\\nwell struck !\\nthere was blow for blow .\\nthou baggage , let me in .\\nmaster , knock the door hard .\\nyou\\'ll cry for this , minion , if i beat the door down .\\nare you there , wife ?\\nyou might have come before .\\nif you went in pain , master , this knave would go sore .\\nin debating which was best , we shall part with neither .\\nyou would say so , master , if your garments were thin .\\nyour cake there is warm within ; you stand here in the cold .\\nit would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold .\\ngo , fetch me something : i\\'ll break ope the gate .\\nhere\\'s too much \"out upon thee ! \" i pray thee , let me in .\\nwell , i\\'ll break in .\\ngo , borrow me a crow .\\na crow without feather ?\\nmaster , mean you so ?\\nfor a fish without a fin , there\\'s a fowl without a feather. , go , get thee gone .\\nfetch me an iron crow .\\nhave patience , sir .\\no , let it not be so .\\nand doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you .\\nbe ruled by me ; depart in patience , and let us to the tiger all to dinner , and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint .\\nyou have prevailed .\\ni will depart in quiet and , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .\\ni know a wench of excellent discourse , pretty and witty , wild and yet , too , gentle .\\nthere will we dine .\\nthat chain will i bestow , be it for nothing but to spite my wife , upon mine hostess there .\\ni\\'ll meet you at that place some hour hence .\\ndo so .\\nthis jest shall cost me some expense .\\nshall , antipholus , even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot ?\\nif you did wed my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth\\'s sake use her with more kindness .\\nwhat simple thief brags of his own attaint ?\\ntis double wrong to truant with your bed and let her read it in thy looks at board .\\nthough others have the arm , show us the sleeve ; we in your motion turn , and you may move us .\\nthen , gentle brother , get you in again .\\nsweet mistress , what your name is else i know not , nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , ,\\nless in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth\\'s wonder , more than earth divine .\\nteach me , dear creature , how to think and speak .\\nagainst my soul\\'s pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field ?\\nare you a god ?\\nwould you create me new ?\\ntransform me , then , and to your power i\\'ll yield .\\nbut

transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i \\' th \\' wheel .\\nan if the wind blow any way from shore , i will not harbor in this town tonight .\\nif any bark put forth , come to the mart , where i will walk till thou return to me .\\nif every one knows us , and we know none , \\'t is time , i think , to trudge , pack , and be gone .\\nas from a bear a man would run for life , so fly i

.\\nwhy , man , what is the matter ?\\ntell me at whose suit .\\ni know not at whose suit he is arrested well , but he\\'s in a suit of buff which \\'rested him ; that can i tell .\\ngo fetch it ,

left him , and now the clock strikes one .\\nthat did i never hear .\\nexcellent well .\\nyou are a fishmonger .\\nnot i , my lord .\\nthen i would you were so honest a man .\\nhonest , my lord ?\\nay , sir .\\nto be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand .\\nthat\\'s very true , my lord .\\nfor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog , being a good kissing carrion

overhappy .\\non fortune\\'s cap we are not the very button .\\nthen you live about her waist , or in the middle of her favors ?\\nfaith , her privates we .\\nwhat news ?\\nbut your news is not true .\\nlet me question more in particular .\\nwhat have you , my good friends , deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither ?\\nprison , my lord ?\\ndenmark\\'s a prison .\\nthen is the world one .\\na goodly one , in which there are many confines , wards , and dungeons , denmark being one o \\' th \\' worst .\\nwe think not so , my lord .\\nwhy , then , \\'tis none to you , for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so .\\nto me it is a prison .\\nwhy then , your ambition makes it one .\\ntis too narrow for your mind .\\nwhich dreams indeed are ambition , for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream .\\na dream itself is but a shadow .\\ntruly , and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow\\'s shadow .\\nthen are our beggars bodies , and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars \\' shadows .\\nshall we to th \\' court ?\\nbeggar that i am , i am even poor in thanks ; but i thank you , and sure , dear friends , my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .\\nis it your own inclining ?\\nwhat should we say , my lord ?\\nyou were sent for , and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color .\\ni know the good king and queen have sent for you .\\nto what end , my lord ?\\nthat you must teach me .\\nmy lord , we were sent for .\\nwhat might be toward , that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint laborer with the day ?\\nwho is \\'t that can inform me ?\\nthat can i .\\ni will tell you why .\\nwhy did you laugh then , when i said \"man delights not me\" ?\\nhe that plays the king shall be welcome .\\nthe adventurous knight shall use his foil and target , the lover shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace , the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o \\' th \\' sear , and the lady shall say her mind freely , or the blank verse shall halt for \\'t .\\nwhat players are they ?\\neven those you were wont to take delight in , the tragedians of the city .\\nhow chances it they travel ?\\ntheir residence , both in reputation and profit , was better both ways .\\ni think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation .\\ndo they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city ?\\nare they so followed ?\\nno , indeed are they not .\\nhow comes it ?\\ndo they grow rusty ?\\nnay , their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace .\\nbut there is , sir , an eyrie of children , little eyases , that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for \\'t .\\nthese are now the fashion , and so berattle the common stages , so they call them , that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither .\\nwhat , are they children ?\\nwho maintains \\'em ?\\nhow are they escoted ?\\nwill they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing ?\\nwill they not say afterwards , if they should grow themselves to common players ( as it is most like if their means are no better ) , their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession ?\\nfaith , there has been much to do on both sides , and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy .\\nthere was , for a while , no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question .\\nis \\'t possible ?\\noh , there has been much throwing about of brains .\\ndo the boys carry it away ?\\nit is not very strange .\\nfor my uncle is king of denmark , and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .\\nsblood , there is something in this more than natural , if philosophy could find it out .\\nthere are the players .\\ngentlemen , you are welcome to elsinore .\\nyour hands , come then .\\nlet me comply with you in this garb , lest my extent to the players , which , i tell you , must show fairly outwards , should more appear like entertainment than yours .\\nyou are welcome .\\nbut my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived .\\nin what , my dear lord ?\\ni am but mad north-north-west .\\nwhen the wind is southerly , i know a hawk from a handsaw .\\nwell be with you , gentlemen .\\nhark you , guildenstern , and you too , at each ear a hearer .\\nhappily he\\'s the second time come to them , for they say an old man is twice a child .\\nmy lord , i have news to tell you .\\nmy lord , i have news to tell you .\\nwhen roscius was an actor in rome , the actors are come hither , my

lord ?\\nbut it was , as i received it , and others , whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine , an excellent play , well digested in the scenes , set down with as much modesty as cunning .\\none speech in it i chiefly loved .\\nthis is too long .\\nit shall to the barber\\'s , with your beard. , prithee , say on .\\nthe mobled queen\" ?\\nthat\\'s good .\\nmobled queen\" is good .\\nlook whe\\'e he has not turned his color and has tears in \\'s eyes. , prithee , no more .\\nmy lord , i will use them according to their desert .\\ngod\\'s bodykins , man , much better .\\nuse them after your own honor and dignity .\\nthe less they deserve , the more merit is in your bounty .\\ntake them in .\\ncome , sirs .\\nfollow him , friends .\\nwe\\'ll hear a play tomorrow .\\nay , my lord .\\nwe\\'ll ha \\'t tomorrow night .\\nyou could , for a need , study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in \\'t , could you not ?\\nay , my lord .\\nvery well .\\nfollow that lord , and look you mock him not .\\nmy good friends , i\\'ll leave you till night .\\nyou are welcome to elsinore .\\ngood my lord .\\nnow i am alone .\\noh , what a rogue and peasant slave am i !\\nand all for nothing , for hecuba !\\nand terms compulsatory , those foresaid lands so by his father lost .\\nin the most high and palmy state of rome , a little ere the mightiest julius fell , the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood , disasters in the sun , and the moist star upon whose influence neptune\\'s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse .\\nbut soft , behold !\\nlo , where it comes again .\\ni\\'ll cross it though it blast me. , stay , illusion !\\nif thou hast any sound or use of voice , speak to me .\\nam i a coward ?\\nplucks off my beard and blows it in my face ?\\ntweaks me by the nose ?\\nwho does me this ?\\nbloody , bawdy villain !\\nremorseless , treacherous , lecherous , kindless villain !\\no vengeance !\\nwhy , what an ass am i !\\nfie upon \\'t , foh !\\nfor murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .\\nif he do blench , i know my course .\\ni\\'ll have grounds more relative than this .\\nthe play\\'s the thing wherein i\\'ll catch the conscience of the king .\\nand can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion , grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?\\ndid he receive you well ?\\nmost like a gentleman .\\nniggard of question , but of our demands most free in his reply .\\nmadam , it so fell out , that certain players we o\\'erraught on the way .\\nthey are about the court , and , as i think , they have already order this night to play before him .\\ntis most true , and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter .\\nwith all my heart , and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined .\\ngood gentlemen , give him a further edge , and drive his purpose on to these delights .\\nwe shall , my lord .\\ni shall obey you .\\nmadam , i wish it may .\\nophelia , walk you here .\\nlet\\'s withdraw , my lord .\\nto die , to sleep , no more , and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to , \\'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished !\\nto die , to sleep .\\nthere\\'s the respect that makes calamity of so long life .\\nfor who would bear the whips and scorns of time , th \\' oppressor\\'s wrong , the proud man\\'s contumely , the pangs of despised love , the law\\'s delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns that patient merit of th \\' unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ?\\nwho would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat under a weary life , but that the dread of something after death , the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns , puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of ?\\ngood my lord , how does your honor for this many a day ?\\ni humbly thank you .\\nwell , well , well .\\nmy lord , i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver .\\ni pray you now receive them .\\nthere , my lord .\\nha , ha , are you honest ?\\nmy lord ?\\nare you fair ?\\nwhat means your lordship ?\\nthat if you be honest and fair , your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty .\\ncould beauty , my lord , have better commerce than with honesty ?\\nay , truly , for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness .\\nthis was sometime a paradox , but now the time gives it proof .\\ni did love you once .\\nindeed , my lord , you made me believe so .\\ni loved you not .\\ni was the more deceived .\\nget thee to a nunnery .\\ni am very proud , revengeful , ambitious , with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in , imagination to give them shape , or time to act them in .\\nwhat should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven ?\\nwe are arrant knaves , all .\\nbelieve none of us .\\ngo thy ways to a nunnery .\\nwhere\\'s your father ?\\nat home , my lord .\\nlet the doors be shut upon him , that he may play the fool no

.\\nto a nunnery , go .\\nlove ?\\nhis affections do not that way tend .\\nhaply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something-settled matter in his heart , whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself .\\nwhat think you on \\'t ?\\nit shall do well .\\nbut yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love. , how now , ophelia ?\\nyou need not tell us what lord hamlet said .\\nlet her be round with him , and i\\'ll be placed , so please you , in the ear of all their conference .\\nif she find him not , to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .\\nit shall be so .\\nif there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me , speak to me .\\nor

strike at it with my partisan ?\\ndo , if it will not stand .\\ntis here .\\ntis here .\\ntis gone .\\nit was about to speak when the cock crew .\\nspeak the speech , i pray you , as i pronounced it to you , trippingly on the tongue .\\noh , it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters , to very rags , to split the ears of the groundlings , who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise .\\ni would have such a fellow whipped for o\\'erdoing termagant .\\npray you , avoid it .\\ni warrant your honor .\\nbe not too tame neither , but let your own discretion be your tutor .\\ni hope we have reformed that indifferently with us , sir .\\no , reform it altogether !\\nand let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too , though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered .\\nand the queen too , and that presently .\\nbid the players make haste .\\nwill you two help to hasten them ?\\nay , my lord .\\nwhat ho , horatio !\\nhere , sweet lord , at your service .\\nhoratio , thou art e\\'en as just a man as e\\'er my conversation coped withal .\\no my dear lord , nay , do not think i flatter .\\nfor what advancement may i hope from thee that no revenue hast but thy good spirits , to feed and clothe thee ?\\nwhy should the poor be flattered ?\\nno , let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning .\\ndost thou hear ?\\nsince my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish , her election hath sealed thee for herself , for thou hast been , as one in

, in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep .\\nmethought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes .\\nis \\'t possible ?\\ni beseech you .\\nwilt thou know th \\' effect of what i wrote ?\\nay , good my lord .\\ni had my father\\'s signet in my purse , which was the model of that danish seal .\\nfolded the writ up in form of th \\' other , subscribed it , gave \\'t th

our nature come in further evil ?\\nit must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there .\\nit will be short .\\nthe interim\\'s mine .\\ni\\'ll court his favors

your lordship were at leisure , i should impart a thing to you from his majesty .\\ni thank your lordship .\\nit is very hot .\\nit is indifferent cold , my lord , indeed .\\nbut yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion .\\nexceedingly , my lord .\\nit is very sultry , as \\'twere , i can not tell how .\\nmy lord , his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head .\\nsir , this is the matter , i beseech you , remember , nay , good my lord , for mine ease , in good faith .\\nsir , his definement suffers no perdition in you , though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th \\' arithmetic of memory , and yet but yaw neither , in respect of his quick sail .\\na truant disposition , good my lord .\\ni would not hear your enemy say so , nor

ere you depart .\\nmy lord , i came to see your father\\'s funeral .\\ni pray thee , do not mock me , fellow student .\\ni think it was to see my mother\\'s wedding .\\nindeed , my lord , it followed

faith , if you did , it would not much approve me .\\nwell , sir ?\\nyou are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is ,\\ni dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence , but to know a man well were to know himself .\\ni mean , sir , for his weapon .\\nrapier and dagger .\\nthat\\'s two of his weapons .\\nbut well .\\nthe king , sir , hath wagered with him six barbary horses , against the which he has impawned , as i take it , six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns , as girdle , hangers , and so .\\nthree of the carriages , in faith , are very dear to fancy , very responsive to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberal conceit .\\nwhat call you the carriages ?\\nthe carriages , sir , are the hangers .\\nthe phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides .\\ni would it might be hangers till then .\\nbut , on : six barbary horses against six french swords , their assigns , and three liberal-conceited carriages , that\\'s the french bet against the danish .\\nwhy is this \"impawned , \" as you call it ?\\nthe king , sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him , he shall not exceed you three hits .\\nhow if i answer \"no\" ?\\nif it please his majesty , \\'tis the breathing time of day with me .\\ni commend my duty to your lordship .\\nyours , yours .\\nhe does well to commend it himself .\\nthere are no tongues else for \\'s turn .\\nhe did comply , sir , with his dug before he sucked it .\\nhe sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes ,

lose this wager , my lord .\\ni do not think so .\\nsince he went into france , i have been in continual practice .\\ni shall win at the odds .\\nbut thou wouldst not think how ill all\\'s here about my heart .\\nbut it is no matter .\\ni will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .\\nnot a whit .\\nwe defy augury .\\nif it be not to come , it will be now .\\nsince no man of aught he leaves knows , what is \\'t to leave betimes ?\\nlet be .\\ncome , hamlet , come , and take this hand from me .\\nbut in my terms of honor i stand aloof , and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters , of known honor , i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored .\\ncome , one for me .\\ni\\'ll be your foil , laertes .\\nyou mock me , sir .\\nno , by this hand .\\nvery well , my lord .\\nyour grace hath laid the odds o \\' th \\' weaker side .\\ni have seen you both .\\nbut since he is better we have therefore odds .\\nay , my good lord .\\nset me the stoups of wine upon that table .\\nif hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange , let all the battlements their ordnance fire !\\nthe king shall drink to hamlet\\'s

barnardo , on their watch , in the dead waste and middle of the night , been thus encountered : a figure like your father , armed at point exactly , cap-a-pie , appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them .\\nthrice he walked by their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes within his truncheon\\'s length , whilst they , distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear , stand dumb and speak not to him .\\ni knew your father .\\nbut where was this ?\\ntreason !\\ntreason !\\no , yet defend me , friends .\\ni am but hurt .\\nhere , thou incestuous , murderous , damned

.\\nwhat is between you ?\\ngive me up the truth .\\nhe hath , my lord , of late made many tenders of his affection to me .\\naffection !\\npooh , you speak like a green girl , unsifted in such

ta\\'en these tenders for true pay , which are not sterling .\\ntender yourself more dearly , or , not to crack the wind of the poor phrase , running it thus , you\\'ll tender me a fool .\\ngo to , go

let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us .\\ntherefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night , that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it .\\nit is a nipping and an eager air .\\nwhat hour now ?\\ni think it lacks of twelve .\\nno , it is struck .\\nindeed ?\\ni heard it not .\\nit then draws near the

, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .\\nmoreover that we much did long to see you , the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending .\\nsomething have you heard of hamlet\\'s

.\\nis not this something more than fantasy ?\\nwhat think you on \\'t ?\\nbefore my god , i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes .\\nis it not like the king ?\\nas thou art to thyself .\\nsuch was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated .\\nso frowned he once when , in an angry parle , he smote the sledded polacks on the ice .\\ntis strange .\\nand i do think , or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath used to do , that i have found the very cause of hamlet\\'s lunacy .\\noh , speak of that .\\nthat do i long to hear .\\ngive first admittance to th \\' ambassadors .\\nmy news shall be the fruit to that great feast .\\nthyself do grace to them , and bring them in .\\nhe tells me , my

him. , welcome , my good friends !\\nsay , voltemand , what from our brother norway ?\\nwhereat grieved , that so his sickness , age , and impotence was falsely borne in hand , sends out arrests on fortinbras , which he , in brief , obeys , receives rebuke from norway , and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th \\' assay of arms against your majesty .\\nwhereon old norway , overcome with joy ,\\ngives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers , so levied as before , against the polack , with an entreaty , herein further shown , that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise , on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down .\\nmeantime we thank you for your well-took labor .\\ngo to your rest .\\nat night we\\'ll feast together .\\nmost welcome home !\\nthis business is well ended .\\nmy liege and madam , to expostulate what majesty should be , what duty is , why day is day , night night , and time is time , were nothing but to waste night , day , and time .\\ntherefore , since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes , i will be brief : your noble son is mad .\\nmad call i it , for , to define true madness , what is \\'t but to be nothing else but mad ?\\nbut let that go .\\nthus it remains , and the remainder thus .\\ni have a daughter , have while she is mine , who in her duty and obedience , mark , hath given me this .\\ngood madam , stay a while .\\ni will be faithful .\\no dear ophelia , i am ill at these numbers .\\ni have not art to reckon my groans , but that i love thee best , oh , most best , believe it .\\nadieu .\\nhamlet.\" this in obedience hath my daughter shown me , and more above , hath his solicitings , as they fell out by time , by means , and place , all given to mine ear .\\nbut how hath she received his love ?\\nwhat do you think of me ?\\nas of a man faithful and honorable .\\ni would fain prove so .\\nwhat might you think ?\\nno , i went round to work , and my young mistress thus i did bespeak : \"lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star .\\nit may be , very like .\\nhath there been such a time , i would fain know that , that i have positively said , \"\\'tis so , \" when it proved otherwise ?\\nnot that i know .\\nhow may we try it further ?\\nyou know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby .\\nso he does indeed .\\nat such a time i\\'ll loose my daughter to him .\\naway , i do beseech you , both away .\\ni\\'ll board him presently .\\no , give me leave .\\nhow does my good lord hamlet ?\\nwell , god-\\'a\\'-mercy .\\ndo you know me , my lord ?\\nthe town is beseeched , and the trumpet call us to the breach , and we talk and , be chrish , do nothing , \\'tis shame for us all .\\nso god sa \\' me , \\'tis shame to stand still .\\nby the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber , ay\\'ll de gud service , or i\\'ll lig i \\' th \\' grund for it , ay , or go to death .\\ncaptain macmorris , i think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation , of my nation ?\\nwhat ish my nation ?\\nish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal .\\nwhat ish my nation ?\\nwho talks of my nation ?\\nlook you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , captain macmorris , peradventure i shall think you do not use me with that affability as , in discretion , you ought to use me , look you , being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities .\\ni do not know you so good a man as myself .\\nso chrish save me , i will cut off your head .\\ngentlemen both , you will mistake each other .\\nah , that\\'s a foul fault .\\nthe town sounds a parley .\\ncaptain macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , i will be so bold as to tell you i know the disciplines of war , and there is an end .\\nhow yet resolves the governor of the town ?\\nthis is the latest parle we will admit .\\ntherefore to our best mercy give yourselves or , like to men proud of destruction , defy us to our worst .\\nfor , as i am a soldier , a name that in my thoughts becomes me best , if i begin the batt\\'ry once again , i will not leave the half-achieved harfleur till in her ashes she lie buried .\\nthe gates of mercy shall be all shut up , and the fleshed soldier , rough and hard of heart , in liberty of bloody hand , shall range with conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flow\\'ring infants .\\nwhat rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career ?\\nwe may as bootless spend our vain command upon th \\' enraged soldiers in their spoil as send precepts to the leviathan to come ashore .\\nwhat say you ?\\nwill you yield and this avoid or , guilty in defense , be thus destroyed ?\\nour expectation hath this day an end .\\nthe dauphin , whom of succors we entreated , returns us that his powers are yet not ready to raise so great a siege .\\ntherefore , great king , we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .\\nopen your gates .\\ncome , uncle exeter , go you and enter harfleur .\\nthere remain and fortify it strongly \\'gainst the french .\\ntonight in harfleur will we be your guest ; tomorrow for the march are we addressed .\\nit must be so , for miracles are ceased , and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected .\\ndoth his majesty incline to it or no ?\\nd\\'elbow.\" \"d\\'elbow , \" \"de nick , \" \"de nick.\" \"de chin.\" \"de sin.\"\\ntis certain he hath passed the river somme .\\nan if he be not fought withal , my lord , let us not live in france .\\nlet us quit all and give our vineyards to a barbarous people .\\nnormans , but bastard normans , norman bastards !\\nunfought withal , but i will sell my dukedom to buy a slobb\\'ry and a dirty farm in that nook-shotten isle of albion .\\nis not their climate foggy , raw , and dull , on whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale , killing their fruit with frowns ?\\nand shall our quick blood , spirited with wine , seem frosty ?\\nwhere is montjoy the herald ?\\nspeed him hence .\\nlet him greet england with our sharp defiance .\\nup , princes , and , with spirit of honor edged more sharper than your swords , hie to the field : charles delabreth , high constable of france ; you dukes of orleans , bourbon , and of berri , alencon , brabant , bar , and burgundy ; jacques chatillon , rambures , vaudemont , beaumont , grandpre , roussi , and faulconbridge , foix , lestrale , bouciqualt , and charolois ; high dukes , great princes , barons , lords , and knights , for your great seats now quit you of great shames .\\nbar harry england , that sweeps through our land with pennons painted in the blood of harfleur .\\ntherefore , lord constable , haste on montjoy and let him say to england that we send to know what willing ransom he will give .\\nprince dauphin , you shall stay with us in rouen .\\nnot so , i do beseech your majesty .\\nbe patient , for you shall remain with us .\\nnow forth , lord constable and princes all , and quickly bring us word of england\\'s fall .\\nis the duke of exeter safe ?\\nhe is called aunchient pistol .\\ni know him not .\\nhere is the man .\\ncaptain , i thee beseech to do me favors .\\nthe duke of exeter doth love thee well .\\nay , i praise god , and i have merited some love at his hands .\\nfortune is an excellent moral .\\na damned death !\\naunchient pistol , i do partly understand your meaning .\\ndie and be damned , and it is well .\\nwhy , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal .\\ni\\'ll assure you , he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer\\'s day .\\ntrick up with new-tuned oaths ; and what a beard of the general\\'s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits is wonderful to be thought on .\\nbut you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvelously mistook .\\nif i find a hole in his coat , i will tell him my mind .\\nhow now , fluellen , cam\\'st thou from the bridge ?\\nay , so please your majesty .\\nthe duke of exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge .\\nthe french is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages .\\nmarry , th \\' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the duke of exeter is master of the pridge .\\ni can tell your majesty , the duke is a prave man .\\nwhat men have you lost , fluellen ?\\nthe perdition of th \\' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great .\\nmarry , for my part , i think the duke hath lost never a man , but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church , one bardolph , if your majesty know the man .\\nwe would have all such offenders so cut off , and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the french upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .\\nyou know me by my habit .\\nwell then , i know thee .\\nwhat shall i know of thee ?\\nmy master\\'s mind .\\nunfold it .\\nthus says my king : \"say thou to harry of england , though we seemed dead , we did but sleep .\\nadvantage is a better soldier than rashness .\\ntell him we could have rebuked him at harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe .\\nnow we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial .\\nwith good acceptance of his majesty , save that there was not time enough to hear , as i perceived his grace would fain have done , the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms , and generally to the crown and seat of france , derived from edward , his great-grandfather .\\nwhat was th \\' impediment that broke this off ?\\nthe french ambassador upon that instant craved audience .\\nand the hour , i think , is come to give him hearing .\\nis it four o\\'clock ?\\nit is .\\nthen go we in to know his embassy , which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it .\\nbid him therefore consider of his ransom , which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested , which , in weight to reanswer , his pettiness would bow under .\\nfor our losses , his exchequer is too poor ; for th \\' effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number ; and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction .\\nto this , add defiance , and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced.\" so far my king and master ; so much my office .\\nwhat is thy name ?\\ni know thy quality .\\nmontjoy .\\nthou dost thy office fairly .\\nturn thee back , and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment , for , to say the sooth , though \\'tis no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage , my people are with sickness much enfeebled , my numbers lessened , and those few i have almost no better than so many french , who when they were in health , i tell thee , herald , i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen .\\nyet , forgive me , god , that i do brag thus .\\ngo therefore , tell thy master : here i am .\\ni shall deliver so .\\nthanks to your highness .\\ni hope they will not come upon us now .\\nwe are in god\\'s hand , brother , not in theirs .\\nmarch to the bridge .\\nit now draws toward night .\\ntut , i have the best armor of the world .\\nwould it were day !\\nyou have an excellent armor , but let my horse have his due .\\nit is the best horse of europe .\\nwill it never be morning ?\\nmy lord of orleans , and my lord high constable , you talk of horse and armor ?\\nyou are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .\\nwhat a long night is this !\\ni will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .\\nhe bounds from the earth , as if his entrails were hairs , le cheval volant , the pegasus , qui a les narines de feu .\\nthe earth sings when he touches it .\\nthe basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of hermes .\\nhe\\'s of the color of the nutmeg .\\nand of the heat of the ginger .\\nit is a beast for perseus .\\nhe is indeed a horse , and all other jades you may call beasts .\\nindeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .\\nit is the prince of palfreys .\\nhis neigh is like the bidding of a monarch , and his countenance enforces homage .\\nno more , cousin .\\nnay , the man hath no wit that can not , from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb , vary deserved praise on my palfrey .\\nit is a theme as fluent as the sea .\\nturn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all .\\ntis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign\\'s sovereign to ride on , and for the world , familiar to us and unknown , to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .\\ni once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus : \"wonder of nature , \" i have heard a sonnet begin so to one\\'s mistress .\\nthen did they imitate that which i composed to my courser , for my horse is my mistress .\\nyour mistress bears well .\\nso perhaps did yours .\\nmine was not bridled .\\noh , then belike she was old and gentle , and you rode , like a kern of ireland , your french hose off and in your straight strossers .\\nyou have good judgment in horsemanship .\\nbe warned by me , then : they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs .\\ni had rather have my horse to my mistress .\\ni had as lief have my mistress a jade .\\ni tell thee , constable , my mistress wears his own hair .\\ni could make as true a boast as that if i had a sow to my mistress .\\nle chien est retourne a son propre vomissement , et la truie lavee au bourbier.\" thou mak\\'st use of anything .\\nyet do i not use my horse for my mistress , or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .\\nmy lord constable , the armor that i saw in your tent tonight , are those stars or suns upon it ?\\nstars , my lord .\\nsome of them will fall tomorrow , i hope .\\nand yet my sky shall not want .\\nthat may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and \\'twere more honor some were away .\\nev\\'n as your horse bears your praises , who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted .\\nwould i were able to load him with his desert !\\nwill it never be day ?\\ni will not say so , for fear i should be faced out of my way .\\ntis midnight .\\ni\\'ll go arm myself .\\nthe dauphin longs for morning .\\nhe longs to eat the english .\\nswear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .\\nhe is simply the most active gentleman of france .\\ndoing is activity , and he will still be doing .\\nhe never did harm that i heard of .\\nnor will do none tomorrow .\\nhe will keep that good name still .\\ni know him to be valiant .\\ni was told that by one that knows him better than you .\\nwhat\\'s he ?\\nmarry , he told me so himself ; and he said he cared not who knew it .\\nhe needs not .\\nit is no hidden virtue in him .\\ntis a hooded valor , and when it appears , it will bate .\\nill will never said well .\\nhave at the very eye of that proverb with \"a pox of the devil.\" you are the better at proverbs , by how much \"a fool\\'s bolt is soon shot.\" you have shot over .\\ntis not the first time you were overshot .\\nmy lord high constable , the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .\\nwho hath measured the ground ?\\nthe lord grandpre .\\nalas , poor harry of england !\\nhe longs not for the dawning as we do .\\nwhat a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of england to mope with his fat-brained followers so far out of his knowledge .\\nif the english had any apprehension , they would run away .\\nthat they lack , for if their heads had any intellectual armor , they could never wear such heavy head-pieces .\\nthat island of england breeds very valiant creatures .\\ntheir mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .\\nfoolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples .\\nyou may as well say , that\\'s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .\\njust , just ; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives .\\nand then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .\\nay , but these english are shrewdly out of beef .\\nthen shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight .\\nnow is it time to arm .\\ncome , shall we about it ?\\nit is now two o\\'clock .\\nbut , let me see , by ten we shall have each a hundred englishmen .\\nnow entertain conjecture of a time when creeping murmur and the poring dark fills the wide vessel of the universe .\\noh , now , who will behold the royal captain of this ruined band\\nwhere is my gracious lord of canterbury ?\\nnot here in presence .\\nsend for him , good uncle .\\nshall we call in th \\' ambassador , my liege ?\\nnot yet , my cousin .\\nwe would be resolved , before we hear him , of some things of weight that task our thoughts concerning us and france .\\ngod and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it .\\nsure we thank you .\\nmy learned lord , we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim .\\nand god forbid , my dear and faithful lord , that you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading , or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate , whose right suits not in native colors with the truth ; for god doth know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation\\nlet him cry , \"praise and glory on his head ! \" for forth he goes and visits all his host , bids them good morrow with a modest smile , and calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen .\\nupon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him , nor doth he dedicate one jot of color unto the weary and all-watched night , but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty , that every wretch , pining and pale before , beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks .\\ngloucester , \\'tis true that we are in great danger .\\nthe greater therefore should our courage be .\\ngood morrow , brother bedford .\\ngod almighty , there is some soul of goodness in things evil , would men observingly distill it out .\\nfor our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers , which is both healthful and good husbandry .\\nbesides , they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all , admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end .\\nthus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself .\\ngood morrow , old sir thomas erpingham .\\na good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france .\\nso the spirit is eased .\\nand when the mind is quickened , out of doubt , the organs , though defunct and dead before , break up their drowsy grave and newly move , with casted slough and fresh legerity .\\nlend me thy cloak , sir thomas .\\nwe shall , my liege .\\nshall i attend your grace ?\\nno , my good knight .\\ngo with my brothers to my lords of england .\\ni and my bosom must debate awhile , and then i would no other company .\\nthe lord in heaven bless thee , noble harry !\\na friend .\\ndiscuss unto me : art thou officer or art thou base , common , and popular ?\\ni am a gentleman of a company .\\ntrail\\'st thou the puissant pike ?\\neven so .\\nwhat are you ?\\nas good a gentleman as the emperor .\\nthen you are a better than the king .\\nthe king\\'s a bawcock , and a heart of gold , a lad of life , an imp of fame , of parents good , of fist most valiant .\\ni kiss his dirty shoe , and from heartstring i love the lovely bully .\\nwhat is thy name ?\\nharry le roy .\\nle roy ?\\na cornish name .\\nart thou of cornish crew ?\\nno , i am a welshman .\\nknow\\'st thou fluellen ?\\nyes .\\ntell him i\\'ll knock his leek about his pate upon saint davy\\'s day .\\ndo not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .\\nart thou his friend ?\\nand his kinsman too .\\nthe i thank you .\\ngod be with you .\\nmy name is pistol called .\\nit sorts well with your fierceness .\\ncaptain fluellen .\\nit is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept .\\nif you would take the pains but to examine the wars of pompey the great , you shall find , i warrant you , that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in pompey\\'s camp .\\ni warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise .\\nwhy , the enemy is loud .\\nyou hear him all night .\\nif the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience , now ?\\ni will speak lower .\\ni pray you and beseech you that you will .\\nthough it appear a little out of fashion , there is much care and valor in this welshman .\\nbrother john bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?\\nwe see yonder the beginning of the day , but i think we shall never see the end of it. , who goes there ?\\na friend .\\nunder what captain serve you ?\\nunder sir thomas erpingham .\\na good old commander and a most kind gentleman .\\ni pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?\\neven as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .\\nhe hath not told his thought to the king ?\\nthe violet smells to him as it doth to me .\\nhis ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man , and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing .\\ntherefore , when he sees reason of fears as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are .\\nyet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .\\nhe may show what outward courage he will , but i believe , as cold a night as \\'tis , he could wish himself in thames up to the neck ; and so i would he were , and i by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .\\nby my troth , i will speak my conscience of the king .\\ni think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .\\ni dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men\\'s minds .\\nmethinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king\\'s company , his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .\\nthat\\'s more than we know .\\nif his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .\\nbut if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make , when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , \"we died at such a place , \" some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left .\\ni am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle , for how can they charitably dispose of anything , when blood is their argument ?\\nthe king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant , for they purpose not their death , when they purpose their services .\\nbesides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrament of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers .\\nnow , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from god .\\nwhere they feared the death , they have borne life away ; and where they would be safe , they perish .\\nthen , if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .\\nevery subject\\'s duty is the king\\'s , but every subject\\'s soul is his own .\\ntherefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed : wash every mote out of his conscience .\\nand , dying so , death is to him advantage ; or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained .\\ntis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head .\\nthe king is not to answer it .\\ni do not desire he should answer for me , and yet i determine to fight lustily for him .\\ni myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .\\nif i live to see it , i will never trust his word after .\\nyou pay him then .\\nthat\\'s a perilous shot out of an elder gun , that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch .\\nyou may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock\\'s feather .\\nyou\\'ll \"never trust his word after.\" come , \\'tis a foolish saying .\\nyour reproof is something too round .\\ni should be angry with you if the time were convenient .\\nlet it be a quarrel between us , if you live .\\ni embrace it .\\nhow shall i know thee again ?\\ngive me any gage of thine , and i will wear it in my bonnet .\\nthen , if ever thou dar\\'st acknowledge it , i will make it my quarrel .\\nthere .\\nthis will i also wear in my cap .\\nif ever thou come to me and say , after tomorrow , \"this is my glove , \" by this hand i will take thee a box on the ear .\\nif ever i live to see it , i will challenge it .\\nthou dar\\'st as well be hanged .\\nwell , i will do it , though i take thee in the king\\'s company .\\nkeep thy word .\\nfare thee well .\\nindeed , the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us , for they bear them on their shoulders .\\nbut it is no english treason to cut french crowns , and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper .\\nof what your reverence shall incite us to .\\ntherefore take heed how you impawn our person , how you awake our sleeping sword of war .\\nunder this conjuration , speak , my lord , for we will hear , note , and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism .\\nthen hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers that owe yourselves , your lives , and services to this imperial throne .\\nupon the king !\\nlet us our lives , our souls , our debts , our careful wives , our children , and our sins lay on the king !\\nwe must bear all .\\no hard condition , twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath of every fool , whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing .\\nwhat infinite heart\\'s ease must kings neglect that private men enjoy ?\\nand what have kings that privates have not too , save ceremony , save general ceremony ?\\nand what art thou , thou idol ceremony ?\\nwhat kind of god art thou , that suffer\\'st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?\\nwhat are thy comings in ?\\no ceremony , show me but thy worth !\\nwhat is thy soul of adoration ?\\nart thou aught else but place , degree , and form , creating awe and fear in other men , wherein thou art less happy , being feared , than they in fearing ?\\nwhat drink\\'st thou oft , instead of homage sweet , but poisoned flattery ?\\noh , be sick , great greatness , and bid thy ceremony give thee cure !\\nthink\\'st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation ?\\nwill it give place to flexure and low bending ?\\ncanst thou , when thou command\\'st the beggar\\'s knee , command the health of it ?\\nno , thou proud dream , that play\\'st so subtly with a king\\'s repose .\\nand , but for ceremony , such a wretch , winding up days with toil and nights with sleep , had the forehand and vantage of a king .\\nmy lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence , seek through your camp to find you .\\ngood old knight , collect them all together at my tent .\\ni\\'ll be before thee .\\ni shall do\\'t , my lord .\\no god of battles , steel my soldiers \\' hearts .\\npossess them not with fear .\\ntake from them now the sense of reck\\'ning ere th \\' opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them .\\nnot today , o lord , oh , not today , think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown .\\ni richard\\'s body have interred anew , and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood .\\nfive hundred poor i have in yearly pay , who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood .\\nand i have built two chantries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richard\\'s soul .\\nmore will i do , though all that i can do is nothing worth , since that my penitence comes after all , imploring pardon .\\nmy liege .\\nmy brother gloucester\\'s voice. , ay , i know thy errand .\\ni will go with thee .\\nthe day , my friends , and all things stay for me .\\nthe sun doth gild our armor .\\nup , my lords .\\nnow , my lord constable ?\\nhark how our steeds for present service neigh .\\nha !\\nwhat , will you have them weep our horses \\' blood ?\\nhow shall we then behold their natural tears ?\\nthe english are embattled , you french peers .\\nto horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse .\\nwhat\\'s to say ?\\nthen let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount , for our approach shall so much dare the field that england shall couch down in fear and yield .\\nwhy do you stay so long , my lords of france ?\\nyond island carrions , desperate of their bones , ill-favoredly become the morning field .\\nbig mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .\\nthey have said their prayers , and they stay for death .\\nshall we go send them dinners and fresh suits , and give their fasting horses provender , and after fight with them ?\\non , to the field !\\ni will the banner from a trumpet take and use it for my haste .\\ncome , come away .\\nthe sun is high , and we outwear the day .\\nwhere is the king ?\\nthe king himself is rode to view their battle .\\nof fighting men they have full threescore

as full of valor as of kindness , princely in both .\\noh , that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in england that do no work today .\\nwhat\\'s he that wishes so ?\\nmy cousin westmoreland ?\\nno , my fair cousin .\\nif we are marked to die , we are enough to do our country loss ; and if to live , the fewer men , the greater share of honor .\\ngod\\'s will , i pray thee wish not one man more .\\nby jove , i am not covetous for gold nor care i who doth feed upon my cost ; it yearns me not if men my garments wear ; such outward things dwell not in my desires .\\nbut if it be a sin to covet honor , i am the most offending soul alive .\\nno , faith , my coz , wish not a man from england .\\ngod\\'s peace , i would not lose so great an honor as one man more , methinks , would share from me , for the best hope i have .\\noh , do not wish one more !\\nhis passport shall be made , and crowns for convoy put into his purse .\\nwe would not die in that man\\'s company that fears his fellowship to die with us .\\nhe that shall see this day , and live old age , will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say , \"tomorrow is saint crispian.\" then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars , and say , \"these wounds i had on crispin\\'s day.\"\\nall things are ready if our minds be so .\\nperish the man whose mind is backward now !\\nthou dost not wish more help from england , coz ?\\ngod be with you all .\\ntucket once more i come to know of thee , king harry , if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound , before thy most assured overthrow .\\nfor certainly thou art so near the gulf thou needs must be englutted .\\nbesides , in mercy , the constable desires thee thou wilt mind thy followers of repentance , that their souls may make a peaceful and a sweet retire from off these fields where , wretches , their poor bodies must lie and fester .\\nwho hath sent thee now ?\\nthe constable of france .\\ni pray thee , bear my former answer back .\\nbid them achieve me and then sell my bones .\\nthe man that once did sell the lion\\'s skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him .\\na many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves , upon the which , i trust , shall witness live in brass of this day\\'s work .\\nand those that leave their valiant bones in france , dying like men though buried in your dunghills , they shall be famed ; for there the sun shall greet them and draw their honors reeking up to heaven , leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,\\nbesides , their writers say , king pepin , which deposed childeric , did , as heir general , being descended of blithild , which was daughter to king clothair , make claim and title to the crown of france .\\nhugh capet also , who usurped the crown of charles the duke of lorraine , sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great , to find his title with some shows of truth , though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught , conveyed himself as th \\' heir to th \\' lady lingare , daughter to charlemagne , who was the son to lewis the emperor , and lewis the son of charles the great .\\nalso king lewis the tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper capet , could not keep quiet in his conscience , wearing the crown of france , till satisfied that fair queen isabel , his grandmother , was lineal of the lady ermengare , daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine , by the which marriage the line of charles the great was reunited to the crown of france .\\nso that , as clear as is the summer\\'s sun , king pepin\\'s title and hugh capet\\'s claim , king lewis his satisfaction , all appear to hold in right and title of the female .\\nlet me speak proudly : tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day ; our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field .\\nthere\\'s not a piece of feather in our host , good argument , i hope , we will not fly , and time hath worn us into slovenry .\\nif they do this , as , if god please , they shall , my ransom then will soon be levied .\\nherald , save thou thy labor .\\ncome thou no more for ransom , gentle herald .\\nthey shall have none , i swear , but these my joints , which , if they have , as i will leave \\'em them , shall yield them little .\\ntell the constable .\\ni shall , king harry .\\nand so fare thee well .\\nthou never shalt hear herald anymore .\\ni fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom .\\nmy lord , most humbly on my knee i beg the leading of the vaward .\\ntake it , brave york .\\nnow , soldiers , march away , and how thou pleasest , god , dispose the day .\\nyield , cur .\\nhe says his name is master fer .\\nmaster fer .\\nwhat are his words ?\\nhe prays you to save his life .\\nhe is a gentleman of a good house , and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns .\\ntell him my fury shall abate , and i the crowns will take .\\nexpound unto me , boy .\\nhe gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks , and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall\\'n into the hands of one , as he thinks , the most brave , valorous , and thrice- worthy seigneur of england .\\nas i suck blood , i will some mercy show .\\nfollow me .\\ni did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart .\\ni must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp .\\nthe french might have a good prey of us if he knew of it , for there is none to guard it but boys .\\nreproach and everlasting shame sits mocking in our plumes .\\ndo not run away .\\nwhy , all our ranks are broke .\\no perdurable shame !\\nlet\\'s stab ourselves .\\nbe these the wretches that we played at dice for ?\\nis this the king we sent to for his ransom ?\\nshame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame !\\nlet us die .\\nand he that will not follow bourbon now , let him go hence , and with his cap in hand like a base pander hold the chamber door , whilst by a slave , no gentler than my dog , his fairest daughter is contaminate .\\ndisorder , that hath spoiled us , friend us now .\\nlet us on heaps go offer up our lives .\\nwe are enough yet living in the field to smother up the english in our throngs , if any order might be thought upon .\\nthe devil take order now !\\ni\\'ll to the throng .\\nlet life be short , else shame will be too long .\\nyet keep the french the field .\\nthe duke of york commends him to your majesty .\\nlives he , good uncle ?\\nthrice within this hour i saw him down , thrice up again and fighting .\\nfrom helmet to the spur , all blood he was .\\nin which array , brave soldier , doth he lie , larding the plain , and by his bloody side , yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds , the noble earl of suffolk also lies .\\nsuffolk first died , and york , all haggled over , comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped and takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes that bloodily did yawn upon his face .\\nand cries aloud , \"tarry , my cousin suffolk .\\nmy soul shall thine keep company to heaven .\\ntarry , sweet soul , for mine ; then fly abreast , as in this glorious and well-foughten field we kept together in our chivalry.\" upon these words i came and cheered him up .\\nthe french have reinforced their scattered men .\\nthen every soldier kill his prisoners .\\ngive the word through .\\nso do the kings of france unto this day , howbeit they would hold up this salic law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurped from you and your progenitors .\\nmay i with right and conscience make this claim ?\\nthe sin upon my head , dread sovereign , for in the book of numbers is it writ : \"when the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.\" gracious lord , stand for your own , unwind your bloody flag , look back into your mighty ancestors .\\ngo , my dread lord , to your great-grandsire\\'s tomb , from whom you claim .\\ninvoke his warlike spirit and your great-uncle\\'s , edward the black prince , who on the french ground played a tragedy , making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion\\'s whelp forage in blood of french nobility .\\no noble english , that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by , all out of work and cold for action !\\nawake remembrance of these valiant dead and with your puissant arm renew their feats .\\nyou are their heir , you sit upon their throne , the blood and courage that renowned them runs in your veins ; and my thrice-puissant liege is in the very may-morn of his youth , ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises .\\nkill the poys and the luggage !\\ntis expressly against the law of arms .\\ntis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offert , in your conscience now , is it not ?\\ntis certain there\\'s not a boy left alive , and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha \\' done this slaughter .\\nbesides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king\\'s tent , wherefore the king , most worthily , hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner\\'s throat .\\noh , \\'tis a gallant king !\\nay , he was porn at monmouth , captain gower .\\nwhy , i pray you , is not \"pig\" great ?\\nthe pig , or the great , or the mighty , or the huge , or the magnanimous are all one reckonings , save the phrase is a little variations .\\ni think alexander the great was born in macedon .\\nhis father was called philip of macedon , as i take it .\\ni think it is in macedon where alexander is porn .\\ni tell you , captain , if you look in the maps of the \\'orld , i warrant you shall find , in the comparisons between macedon and monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike .\\nthere is a river in macedon , and there is also , moreover , a river at monmouth .\\nit is called wye at monmouth , but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river .\\nbut \\'tis all one ; \\'tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both .\\nif you mark

as swift as stones enforced from the old assyrian slings .\\ngo and tell them so .\\nhere comes the herald of the french , my liege .\\nhis eyes are humbler than they used to be .\\nknow\\'st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom ?\\ncom\\'st thou again for ransom ?\\nno , great king .\\ni come to thee for charitable license , that we may wander o\\'er this bloody field to book

of the which , five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights .\\nso that in these ten thousand they have lost , there are but sixteen hundred mercenaries .\\nthe rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of blood and quality .\\nof lusty earls : grandpre and roussi , faulconbridge and foix , beaumont and marle , vaudemont and lestrale .\\nwhere is the number of our english dead ?\\nwhen , without stratagem , but in plain shock and even play of battle , was ever known so great and little loss on one part and on th \\' other ?\\ntake it , god , for it is none but thine .\\ntis wonderful .\\nyes , captain , but with this acknowledgement : that god fought for us .\\nyes , my conscience , he did us great good .\\ndo we all holy rites .\\nvouchsafe to those that have not read the story that i may prompt them ; and of such as have , i humbly pray them to admit th \\' excuse of time , of numbers , and due course of things , which can not in their huge and proper life be here presented .\\nso let him land , and solemnly see him set on to london .\\nso swift a pace hath thought that even now you may imagine him upon blackheath , where that his lords desire him to have borne his bruised helmet and his bended sword before him through the city .\\nhe forbids it , being free from vainness and self-glorious pride , giving full trophy , signal , and ostent quite from himself , to god .\\nbut now behold , in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought , how london doth pour out her citizens .\\nthe mayor and all his brethren in best sort , like to the senators of th \\' antique rome , with the plebeians swarming at their heels , go forth and fetch their conquering caesar in , as , by a lower but loving likelihood ,\\nthen brook abridgment , and your eyes advance after your thoughts , straight back again to france .\\nsaint davy\\'s day is past .\\nthere is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things .\\nit was in place where i could

like a turkey-cock .\\nha , art thou bedlam ?\\nhence .\\ni am qualmish at the smell of leek .\\ni peseech you heartily , scurvy , lousy knave , at my desires , and my requests , and my petitions , to

i pray you .\\nit is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .\\nmust i bite ?\\nyes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question , too , and ambiguities .\\nby this leek , i will most horribly revenge .\\nwill you have some more sauce to your leek ?\\nthere is not enough leek to swear by .\\nquiet thy cudgel .\\nthou dost see i eat .\\nmuch good do you , scald knave , heartily .\\nnay , pray you throw none away .\\nthe skin is good for your broken coxcomb .\\nwhen you take occasions to see leeks hereafter , i pray you , mock at \\'em , that is all .\\ngood .\\nay , leeks is

wi \\' you and keep you and heal your pate .\\nall hell shall stir for this .\\ngo , go .\\nyou are a counterfeit cowardly knave .\\nwill you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor , and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words ?\\ni have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice .\\nyou thought because he could not speak english in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an english cudgel .\\nfare you well .\\ndoth fortune play the huswife with me now ?\\nnews have i that my

something lean to cutpurse of quick hand .\\nto england will i steal , and there i\\'ll steal .\\nand patches will i get unto these cudgeled scars , and swear i got them in the gallia wars .\\nbut there\\'s a saying very old and true : \"if that you will france win , then with scotland first begin.\" for once the eagle england being in prey , to her unguarded nest the weasel scot comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs , playing the mouse in absence of the cat , to \\'tame and havoc more than she can eat .\\nit follows , then , the cat must stay at home .\\nyet that is but a crushed necessity , since we have locks to safeguard necessaries and pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .\\nwhile that the armed hand doth fight abroad , th \\' advised head defends itself at home .\\nright joyous are we to behold your face , most worthy brother england .\\nso are you , princes english , every one .\\nthe venom of such looks , we fairly hope , have lost their quality , and that this day shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .\\nto cry \"amen\" to that , thus we appear .\\nyou english princes all , i do salute you .\\nmy duty to you both , on equal love , great kings of france and england .\\nthat i have labored with all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavors , to bring your most imperial majesties unto this bar and royal interview , your mightiness on both parts best can witness .\\nalas , she hath from france too long been chased , and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps , corrupting in its own fertility .\\nher vine , the merry cheerer of the heart , unpruned , dies .\\nher hedges , even-pleached , like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair , put forth disordered twigs .\\nher fallow leas the darnel , hemlock , and rank fumitory doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery .\\nthe even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover , wanting the scythe , withal uncorrected , rank , conceives by idleness , and nothing teems but hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burrs , losing both beauty and utility .\\nand as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges , defective in their natures , grow to wildness , even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost , or do not learn for want of time , the sciences that should become our country , but grow like savages , as soldiers will\\nthat nothing do but meditate on blood , to swearing and stern looks , diffused attire , and everything that seems unnatural .\\nif , duke of burgundy , you would the peace , whose want gives growth to th \\' imperfections which you have cited , you must buy that peace with full accord to all our just demands , whose tenors and particular effects you have , enscheduled briefly , in your hands .\\nthe king hath heard them , to the which as yet there is no answer made .\\nwell then , the peace which you before so urged lies in his answer .\\ni have but with a cursitory eye o\\'erglanced the articles .\\npleaseth your grace to appoint some of your council presently to sit with us once more with better heed to resurvey them , we will suddenly pass our accept and peremptory answer .\\nand we\\'ll consign thereto. , will you , fair sister , go with the princes or stay here with us ?\\nour gracious brother , i will go with them .\\nhaply a woman\\'s voice may do some good , when articles too nicely urged be stood on .\\nyet leave our cousin katherine here with us .\\nshe is our capital demand , comprised within the forerank of our articles .\\nshe hath good leave .\\nfair katherine , and most fair , will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady\\'s ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart ?\\nyour majesty shall mock at me .\\ni can not speak your england .\\no fair katherine , if you will love me soundly with your french heart , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue .\\ndo you like me , kate ?\\nan angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .\\ni said so , dear katherine ; and i must not blush to affirm it .\\nthe princess is the better englishwoman. , i \\' faith , kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding .\\ni am glad thou canst speak no better english , for if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think i had sold my farm to buy my crown .\\ni know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say , \"i love you.\" then if you urge me farther than to say , \"do you , in faith ? \" i wear out my suit .\\ngive me your answer , i \\' faith , do ; and so clap hands and a bargain .\\nhow say you , lady ?\\nfor the one , i have neither words nor measure ; and for the other , i have no strength in measure , yet a reasonable measure in strength .\\nif i could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken , i should quickly leap into a wife .\\nif thou canst love a fellow of this temper , kate , whose face is not worth sunburning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook .\\ni speak to thee plain soldier .\\nif thou canst love me for this , take me .\\nif not , to say to thee that i shall die is true , but for thy love , by the lord , no .\\nyet i love thee too .\\nand while thou liv\\'st , dear kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places .\\nfor these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rhyme themselves into ladies \\' favors , they do always reason themselves out again .\\nif thou would have such a one , take me .\\nand what say\\'st thou then to my love ?\\nspeak , my fair , and fairly , i pray thee .\\nis it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france ?\\nno , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france , kate .\\nbut , in loving me , you should love the friend of france , for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it .\\ni will have it all mine .\\nand , kate , when france is mine and i am yours , then yours is france and you are mine .\\ni can not tell wat is dat .\\nno , kate ?\\ncan any of your neighbors tell , kate ?\\ni\\'ll ask them .\\nbut , good kate , mock me mercifully , the rather , gentle princess , because i love thee cruelly .\\nshall we not ?\\nwhat say\\'st thou , my fair flower de luce ?\\ni do not know dat .\\nno , \\'tis hereafter to know , but now to promise .\\ndo but now promise , kate , you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy ; and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor .\\nby mine honor , in true english , i love thee , kate .\\nby which honor i dare not swear thou lovest me , yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost , notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage .\\nnow , beshrew my father\\'s ambition !\\nbut , in faith , kate , the elder i wax , the better i shall appear .\\nmy comfort is that old age , that ill layer-up of beauty , can do no more spoil upon my face .\\nthou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst , and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better .\\nand therefore tell me , most fair katherine , will you have me ?\\nput off your maiden blushes , avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress , take me by the hand , and say \"harry of england , i am thine , \" which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal , but i will tell\\nthee aloud \"england is thine , ireland is thine , france is thine , and harry plantagenet is thine , \" who , though i speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows .\\ncome , your answer in broken music , for thy voice is music and thy english broken .\\ntherefore , queen of all , katherine , break thy mind to me in broken english .\\nwilt thou have me ?\\nden it sall also content me .\\nupon that i kiss your hand , and i call you my queen .\\nthen i will kiss your lips , kate .\\nmadam my interpreter , what says she ?\\ndat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of france , i can not tell wat is to kiss .\\nyour it is not a fashion for the maids in france to kiss before they are married , would she say ?\\no kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings .\\ndear kate , you and i can not be confined within the weak list of a country\\'s fashion .\\nwe are the makers of manners , kate , and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults , as i will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss .\\ntherefore , patiently and yielding .\\ngod save your majesty .\\nmy royal cousin , teach you our princess english ?\\ni would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly i love her , and that is good english .\\nis she not apt ?\\nour tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth , so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , i can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness .\\ni this infer : that many things , having full reference to one consent , may work contrariously , as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark , as many ways meet in one town , as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea , as many lines close in the dial\\'s center , so may a thousand actions , once afoot , end in one purpose , and be all well borne without defeat .\\npardon the frankness of my mirth if i answer you for that .\\nif you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind .\\ncan you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self ?\\nit were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .\\nthey are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .\\nthen , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .\\nthis moral ties me over to time and a hot summer .\\nand so i shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end and she must be blind too .\\nas love is , my lord , before it loves .\\nit is so .\\nshall kate be my wife ?\\nso please you .\\ni am content , so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her .\\nso the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .\\nwe have consented to all terms of reason .\\nis \\'t so , my lords of england ?\\nthe king hath granted every article , his daughter first , and , in sequel , all , according to their firm proposed natures .\\nonly he hath not yet subscribed this : where your majesty demands that the king of france , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your highness in this form and with this addition , in french : nor this i have not , brother , so denied but your request shall make me let it pass .\\ni pray you , then , in love and dear alliance , let that one article rank with the rest , and thereupon give me your daughter .\\namen .\\nnow welcome , kate , and bear me witness all that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen .\\ngod , the best maker of all marriages , combine your hearts in one , your realms in one .\\ngod speak this \"amen\" !\\namen .\\nprepare we for our marriage ; on which day , my lord of burgundy , we\\'ll take your oath , and all the peers \\' , for surety of our leagues .\\nthen shall i swear to kate , and you to me , and may our oaths well kept and prosp\\'rous be .\\nthus far with rough and all-unable pen our bending author hath pursued the story , in little room confining mighty men , mangling by starts the full course of their glory .\\nhenry the sixth , in infant bands crowned king of france and england , did this king succeed , whose state so many had the managing that they lost france and made his england bleed , which oft our stage hath shown .\\nand for their sake , in your fair minds let this acceptance take .\\nif we , with thrice such powers left at home , can not defend our own doors from the dog , let us be worried , and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy .\\ncall in the messengers sent from the dauphin .\\nnow are we well prepared to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin , for we hear your greeting is from him , not from the king .\\nmay \\'t please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge , or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin\\'s meaning and our embassy ?\\npiece out our imperfections with your thoughts .\\ninto a thousand parts divide one man , and make imaginary puissance .\\nthink , when we talk of horses , that you see them printing their proud hoofs i \\' th \\' receiving earth , for \\'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings , carry them here and there , jumping o\\'er times ,\\nwe are no tyrant , but a christian king , unto whose grace our passion is as subject as is our wretches fettered in our prisons .\\ntherefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphin\\'s mind .\\nyou can not revel into dukedoms there .\\nhe therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit , this tun of treasure , and , in lieu of this , desires you let the dukedoms that you claim hear no more of you .\\nthis the dauphin speaks .\\nwhat treasure , uncle ?\\ntennis balls , my liege .\\nwe are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us .\\nhis present and your pains we thank you for .\\nwhen we have matched our rackets to these balls , we will in france , by god\\'s grace , play a set shall strike his father\\'s crown into the hazard .\\nand we understand him well , how he comes o\\'er us with our wilder days , not measuring what use we made of them .\\nwe never valued this poor seat of england and therefore , living hence , did give ourself to barbarous license , as \\'tis ever common that men are merriest when they are from home .\\nso get you hence in peace .\\nand tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit when thousands weep more than did laugh at it .\\nthis was a merry message .\\nwe hope to make the sender blush at it .\\ntherefore , my lords , omit no happy hour that may give furth\\'rance to our expedition ; for we have now no thought in us but france , save those to god , that run before our business .\\ntherefore let every man now task his thought , that this fair action may on foot be brought .\\nnow all the youth of england are on fire , and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies .\\nere he take ship for france , and in southampton .\\nthere is the playhouse now , there must you sit , and thence to france shall we convey you safe and bring you back , charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass ; for , if we may , we\\'ll not offend one stomach with our play .\\nbut , till the king come forth , and not till then , unto southampton do we shift our scene .\\nwell met , corporal nym .\\ngood morrow , lieutenant bardolph .\\nwhat , are ancient pistol and you friends yet ?\\nfor my part , i care not .\\ni will bestow a breakfast to make you friends ; and we\\'ll be all three sworn brothers to france .\\nlet \\'t be so , good corporal nym .\\nthat is my rest ; that is the rendezvous of it .\\ni can not tell .\\nthings must be as they may .\\nmen may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time , and some say knives have edges .\\nthere must be conclusions .\\nwell , i can not tell .\\nhere comes ancient pistol and his wife .\\nnow , by this hand , i swear , i scorn the term , nor shall my nell keep lodgers .\\noh , well-a-day , lady !\\npish !\\npish for thee , iceland dog , thou prick-eared cur of iceland !\\ngood corporal nym , show thy valor and put up your sword .\\nwill you shog off ?\\ni am not barbason ; you can not conjure me .\\ni have an humor to knock you indifferently well .\\nif you grow foul with me , pistol , i will scour you with my rapier , as i may , in fair terms .\\no braggart vile and damned furious

years into an hour-glass ; for the which supply , admit me chorus to this history ; who , prologue-like , your humble patience pray gently to hear , kindly to judge our play .\\nnym , thou hast spoke the right .\\nhe passes some humors and careers .\\nthey shall be apprehended by and by .\\nhow smooth and even they do bear themselves , as if allegiance in their bosoms sat crowned with faith and constant loyalty .\\nthe king hath note of all that they intend , by interception which they dream not of .\\nnow sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .\\nmy lord of cambridge , and my kind lord of masham , and you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts .\\nthink you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france , doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them ?\\nno doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .\\ni doubt not that , since we are well-persuaded we carry not a heart with us from hence that grows not in a fair consent with ours , nor leave not one behind that doth not wish success and conquest to attend on us .\\nnever was monarch better feared and loved than is your majesty .\\nthere\\'s not , i think , a subject that sits in heart-grief and uneasiness under the sweet shade of your government .\\ntrue .\\nthose that were your father\\'s enemies have steeped their galls in honey , and do serve you with hearts create of duty and of zeal .\\nwe therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness .\\nwe judge no less. , uncle of exeter , enlarge the man committed yesterday that railed against our person .\\nthat\\'s mercy , but too much security .\\noh , let us yet be merciful .\\nand now to our french causes .\\nwho are the late commissioners ?\\ni one , my lord .\\nyour highness bade me ask for it today .\\nso did you me , my liege .\\nand i , my royal sovereign .\\ni do confess my fault , and do submit me to your highness \\' mercy .\\nto which we all appeal .\\nthe mercy that was quick in us but late by your own counsel is suppressed and killed .\\ntis so strange that , though the truth of it stands off as gross as black and white , my eye will scarcely see it .\\ntreason and murder ever kept together as two yoke-devils sworn to either\\'s purpose , working so grossly in a natural cause that admiration did not whoop at them .\\nall other devils that suggest by treasons do botch and bungle up damnation with patches , colors , and with forms being fetched from glist\\'ring semblances of piety .\\nbut he that tempered thee bade thee stand up , gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason , unless to dub thee with the name of traitor .\\nif that same demon that hath gulled thee thus should with his lion gait walk the whole world , he might return to vasty tartar back and tell the legions \"i can never win a soul so easy as that englishman\\'s.\" oh , how hast thou with jealousy infected the sweetness of affiance !\\nwhy , so didst thou .\\nwhy , so didst thou .\\ncome they of noble family ?\\nwhy , so didst thou .\\nseem they religious ?\\nwhy , so didst thou .\\nsuch and so finely bolted didst thou seem .\\nand thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full-fraught man and best endued with some suspicion .\\ni will weep for thee , for this revolt of thine methinks is like another fall of man. , their faults are open .\\ni arrest thee of high treason , by the name of richard , earl of cambridge .\\ni arrest thee of high treason , by the name of henry , lord scroop of masham .\\ni arrest thee of high treason , by the name of thomas grey , knight , of northumberland .\\nour purposes god justly hath discovered , and i repent my fault more than my death , which i beseech your highness to forgive , although my body pay the price of it .\\nfor me , the gold of france did not seduce , although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended ; but god be thanked for prevention , which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice , beseeching god and you to pardon me .\\nnever did faithful subject more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i do at this hour joy o\\'er myself , prevented from a damned enterprise .\\nmy fault , but not my body , pardon , sovereign .\\ngod quit you in his mercy .\\ntouching our person , seek we no revenge , but we our kingdom\\'s safety must so tender , whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws we do deliver you .\\nget you therefore hence , poor miserable wretches , to your death , the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure , and true repentance of all your dear offences. , bear them hence .\\nwe doubt not of a fair and lucky war , since god so graciously hath brought to light this dangerous treason lurking in our way to hinder our beginnings .\\nwe doubt not now but every rub is smoothed on our way .\\nthen forth , dear countrymen .\\nno king of england if not king of france .\\nfor falstaff , he is dead , and we must earn therefore .\\nhe\\'s in arthur\\'s bosom , if ever man went to arthur\\'s bosom .\\ni hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet .\\nthey say he cried out of sack .\\nay , that he did .\\nand of women .\\nnay , that he did not .\\na could never abide carnation .\\ntwas a color he never liked .\\nhe said once the devil would have him about women .\\nhe did in some sort , indeed , handle women , but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the whore of babylon .\\ndo you not remember he saw a flea stick upon bardolph\\'s nose , and he said it was a black soul burning in hell ?\\nshall we shog ?\\nthe king will be gone from southampton .\\nlook to my chattels and my movables .\\ntherefore , go , clear thy crystals. , yoke-fellows in arms , let us to france , like horse-leeches , my boys , to suck , to suck , the very blood to suck .\\nmy lord , i\\'ll tell you that self bill is urged which in th \\' eleventh year of the last king\\'s reign was like , and had indeed against us passed but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question .\\nbut how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?\\nit must be thought on .\\nif it pass against us , we lose the better half of our possession , for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us , being valued thus : \"as much as would maintain , to the king\\'s honor , full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand and two hundred good esquires ; and , to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil , a hundred almshouses right well supplied ; and to the coffers of the king besides , a thousand pounds by th \\' year.\" thus runs the bill .\\nthis would drink deep .\\nbut what prevention ?\\nthe king is full of grace and fair regard .\\nand a true lover of the holy church .\\nand that\\'s but unwholesome food , they say .\\ntouch her soft mouth , and march .\\nfarewell , hostess .\\nlet housewifery appear .\\nkeep close , i thee command .\\nfarewell .\\nadieu .\\ntherefore the dukes of berri and of brittany , of brabant and of orleans , shall make forth , and you , prince dauphin , with all swift dispatch , to line and new-repair our towns of war with men of courage and with means defendant .\\nfor england his approaches makes as fierce as waters to the sucking of a gulf .\\nand let us do it with no show of fear , no , with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun morris-dance .\\nfor , my good liege , she is so idly kinged , her scepter so fantastically borne by a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth , that fear attends her not .\\noh peace , prince dauphin !\\nyou are too much mistaken in this king .\\nquestion your grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy , how well supplied with noble counselors , how modest in exception , and withal how terrible in constant resolution , and you shall find his vanities forespent were but the outside of the roman brutus , covering discretion with a coat of folly , as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots that shall first spring and be most delicate .\\nwell , \\'tis not so , my lord high constable .\\nbut though we think it so , it is no matter .\\nin cases of defense \\'tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems .\\nup in the air , crowned with the golden sun , saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature and deface the patterns that by god and by french fathers had twenty years been made .\\nthis is a stem of that victorious stock , and let us fear the native mightiness and fate of him .\\nambassadors from harry king of england do crave admittance to your majesty .\\nwe\\'ll give them present audience .\\ngo , and bring them .\\ngood my sovereign , take up the english short , and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head .\\nself-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting .\\nfrom our brother england ?\\nor else what follows ?\\nbloody constraint , for if you hide the crown even in your hearts , there will he rake for it .\\nfor us , we will consider of this further .\\ntomorrow shall you bear our full intent back to our brother england .\\nfor the dauphin , i stand here for him .\\nwhat to him from england ?\\nscorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt , and anything that may not misbecome the mighty sender , doth he prize you at .\\nthus says my king : an if your father\\'s highness do not , in grant of all demands at large , sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty , he\\'ll call you to so hot an answer of it that caves and womby vaultages of france shall chide your trespass and return your mock in second accent of his ordinance .\\nto that end , as matching to his youth and vanity , i did present him with the paris balls .\\nhe\\'ll make your paris louvre shake for it , were it the mistress court of mighty europe .\\nand be assured you\\'ll find a difference , as we his subjects have in wonder found , between the promise of his greener days and these he masters now .\\ntomorrow shall you know our mind at full .\\ndispatch us with all speed , lest that our king come here himself to question our delay , for he is footed in this land already .\\nyou shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions .\\na night is but small breath and little pause to answer matters of this consequence .\\nthus with imagined wing our swift scene flies in motion of no less celerity than that of thought .\\nplay with your fancies and in them behold , upon the hempen tackle , shipboys climbing .\\nhear the shrill whistle , which doth order give to sounds confused .\\nbehold the threaden sails , borne with th \\' invisible and creeping wind , draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea , breasting the lofty surge .\\noh , do but think you stand upon the rivage and behold a city on th \\' inconstant billows dancing , for so appears this fleet majestical holding due course to harfleur .\\nfollow , follow !\\nwork , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege .\\nbehold the ordnance on their carriages , with fatal mouths gaping on girded harfleur .\\nsuppose th \\' ambassador from the french comes back , tells harry that the king doth offer him\\nkatherine his daughter and with her , to dowry , some petty and unprofitable dukedoms .\\nstill be kind and eke out our performance with your mind .\\nonce more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , or close the wall up with our english dead !\\nnow set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide , hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit to his full height .\\non , on , you noblest english , whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof , fathers that , like so many alexanders , have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument .\\ndishonor not your mothers .\\nnow attest that those whom you called fathers did beget you .\\nand you , good yeoman , whose limbs were made in england , show us here the mettle of your pasture .\\nlet us swear that you are worth your breeding , which i doubt not ,\\nwe are blessed in the change .\\nlist his discourse of war , and you shall hear a

.\\nyour honor wins bad humors .\\nas young as i am , i have observed these three swashers .\\ni am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me .\\nthey will steal anything and call it purchase .\\nthey would have me as familiar with men\\'s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers , which makes much against my manhood , if i should take from another\\'s pocket to put into mine , for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs .\\ni must leave them and seek some better service .\\ntheir villainy goes against my weak stomach , and therefore i must cast it up .\\nto the mines ?\\nthe concavities of it is not sufficient , for , look you , th \\' athversary , you may discuss unto the duke , look you , is digt himself four yard under the countermines .\\nby cheshu , i think he will plow up all if there is not better directions .\\nthe duke of gloucester , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an irishman , a very valiant gentleman , i \\' faith .\\nit is captain macmorris , is it not ?\\ni think it be .\\nby cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world .\\ni will verify as much in his beard .\\nhe has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the roman disciplines , than is a puppy dog .\\nhere he comes , and the scots captain , captain jamy , with him .\\ncaptain jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman , that is certain , and of great expedition and knowledge in th \\' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions .\\nby cheshu , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the romans .\\ni say gudday , captain fluellen .\\ngodden to your worship , good captain james .\\nhow now

you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the roman wars ?\\nin the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication , partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline , that is the point .\\nwhat enterprise , popillius ?\\nfare you well .\\nlook how he makes to caesar .\\nmark him .\\ncasca , be sudden , for we fear prevention , brutus , what shall be done ?\\nif this be known , cassius or caesar never shall turn back , for i will slay myself .\\ncassius , be constant .\\ntrebonius knows his time .\\nwhere is metellus cimber ?\\nlet him go and presently prefer his suit to caesar .\\nhe is addressed .\\npress near and second him .\\ncasca , you are the first that rears your hand .\\nare we all ready ?\\nmost high , most mighty , and most puissant caesar , metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart , i must prevent thee , cimber .\\nthese couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children .\\nwhat , brutus ?\\ni could be well moved if i were as you .\\nif i could pray to move , prayers would move me .\\nbut i am constant as the northern star , of whose true-fixed and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament .\\nthe skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .\\nso in the world .\\nand that i am he let me a little show it even in this : that i was constant cimber should be banished , and constant do remain to keep him so .\\nhence !\\nwilt thou lift up olympus ?\\ndoth not brutus bootless kneel ?\\nspeak , hands , for me !\\nliberty !\\nfreedom !\\ntyranny is dead !\\nrun hence , proclaim , cry it about the streets .\\nsome to the common pulpits , and cry out , \"liberty , freedom , and enfranchisement ! \" people and senators , be not

, good cheer .\\nthere is no harm intended to your person , nor to no roman else .\\nso tell them , publius .\\nand leave us , publius , lest that the people , rushing on us , should do your age some

.\\nwhy , he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death .\\nstoop , romans , stoop , and let us bathe our hands in caesar\\'s blood up to the elbows , and besmear our

.\\nbeware the ides of march .\\nwhat man is that ?\\na soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march .\\nset him before me .\\nlet me see his face .\\nfellow , come from the throng .\\nlook upon

shall caesar bleed in sport , that now on pompey\\'s basis lies along no worthier than the dust !\\nay , every man away .\\nbrutus shall lead , and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and

he shall be satisfied and , by my honor , depart untouched .\\ni know that we shall have him well to friend .\\nbut here comes antony. , welcome , mark antony .\\no mighty caesar !\\ndost thou lie so low ?\\nare all thy conquests , glories , triumphs , spoils , shrunk to this little measure ?\\nfare thee well .\\ni know not , gentlemen , what you intend , who else must be let blood , who else is rank .\\nif i myself , there is no hour so fit as caesar\\'s death\\'s hour , nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords , made rich with the most noble blood of all this world .\\ni do beseech ye , if you bear me hard , now , whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke , fulfill your pleasure .\\nlive a thousand years , i shall not find myself so apt to die .\\nno place will please me so , no mean of death , as here by caesar , and by you cut off , the choice and master spirits of this age .\\no antony , beg not your death of us .\\nthey are pitiful .\\nand pity to the general wrong of rome , as fire drives out fire , so pity pity , hath done this deed on caesar .\\nfor your part , to you our swords have leaden points , mark antony .\\nour arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers \\' temper do receive you in with all kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .\\nyour voice shall be as strong as any man\\'s in the disposing of new dignities .\\nonly be patient till we have appeased the multitude , beside themselves with fear , and then we will deliver you the cause , why i , that did love caesar when i struck him , have thus proceeded .\\ni doubt not of your wisdom .\\nlet each man render me his bloody hand .\\nmark antony , pardon me , caius cassius .\\ntherefore i took your hands , but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar .\\nfriends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope : that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous .\\nour reasons are so full of good regard that were you , antony , the son of caesar , you should be satisfied .\\nyou shall , mark antony .\\nbrutus , a word with you .\\nit shall advantage more than do us wrong .\\nmark antony , here , take you caesar\\'s body .\\nyou shall not in your funeral speech blame us , but speak all good you can devise of caesar , and say you do \\'t by our permission .\\nand you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going , after my speech is ended .\\nbe it so .\\ni do desire no more .\\nprepare the body then , and follow us .\\nthou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times .\\nwoe to the hand that shed this costly blood !\\nover thy wounds now do i prophesy , which , like dumb mouths , do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue , a curse shall light upon the limbs of men .\\ndomestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy .\\ni do , mark antony .\\ncaesar did write for him to come to rome .\\nhe did receive his letters and is coming .\\npassion , i see , is catching , for mine eyes , seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine , began to water .\\nis thy master coming ?\\nhe lies tonight within seven leagues of rome .\\npost back with speed , and tell him what hath chanced .\\nthou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace .\\nlend me your hand .\\nwe will be satisfied !\\nlet us be satisfied !\\nthen follow me and give me audience , friends .\\ncassius , go you into the other street and part the numbers .\\nthose that will hear me speak , let \\'em stay here .\\nthose that will follow cassius , go with him , and public reasons shall be rendered of caesar\\'s death .\\ni will hear brutus speak .\\ni will hear cassius and compare their reasons when severally we hear them rendered .\\nthe noble brutus is ascended .\\nbe patient till the last .\\nromans , countrymen , and lovers !\\nhear me for my cause , and be silent that you may hear .\\nbelieve me for mine honor , and have respect to mine honor that you may believe .\\ncensure me in your wisdom , and awake your senses that you may the better judge .\\nif there be any in this assembly , any dear friend of caesar\\'s , to him i say that brutus \\' love to caesar was no less than his .\\nif then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar , this is my answer : not that i loved caesar less , but that i loved rome more .\\nhad you rather caesar were living and die all slaves , than that caesar were dead , to live all free men ?\\nas caesar loved me , i weep for him .\\nas he was fortunate , i rejoice at it .\\nas he was valiant , i honor him .\\nbut , as he was ambitious , i slew him .\\nthere is tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his valor , and death for his ambition .\\nwho is here so base that would be a bondman ?\\nif any , speak , for him have i offended .\\nwho is here so rude that would not be a roman ?\\nif any , speak , for him have i offended .\\nwho is here so vile that will not love his country ?\\nif any , speak , for him have i offended .\\ni pause for a reply .\\nnone , brutus , none .\\nthen none have i offended .\\ni have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus .\\nthe question of his death is enrolled in the capitol .\\nhis glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy , nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .\\nhere comes his body , mourned by mark antony , who , though he had no hand in his death , shall receive the benefit of his dying , a place in the commonwealth , as which of you shall not ?\\nlive , brutus !\\nlive , live !\\nbring him with triumph home unto his house !\\ni am not gamesome .\\ni do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony .\\nlet me not hinder , cassius , your desires .\\ni\\'ll leave you .\\ncassius , be not deceived .\\ntell me , good brutus , can you see your face ?\\nlet him be caesar !\\ncaesar\\'s better parts shall be crowned in brutus !\\nwe\\'ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .\\nmy countrymen , peace , silence !\\nbrutus speaks .\\npeace , ho !\\ngood countrymen , let me depart alone .\\ni do entreat you , not a man depart , save i alone , till antony have spoke .\\nlet him go up into the public chair .\\nwe\\'ll hear him. , noble antony , go up .\\nfor brutus \\' sake , i am beholding to you .\\nwhat does he say of brutus ?\\nhe says for brutus \\' sake he finds himself beholding to us all .\\ntwere best he speak no harm of brutus here .\\nthis caesar was a tyrant .\\nnay , that\\'s certain .\\nwe are blest that rome is rid of him .\\npeace !\\nlet us hear what antony can say .\\nyou gentle romans , peace , ho !\\nlet us hear him .\\nfriends , romans , countrymen , lend me your ears .\\ni come to bury caesar , not to praise him .\\nthe evil that men do lives after them ; the good is oft interred with their bones .\\nso let it be with caesar .\\nthe noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious .\\nif it were so , it was a grievous fault , and grievously hath caesar answered it .\\nhere , under leave of brutus and the rest , for brutus is an honorable man ; so are they all , all honorable men , come i to speak in caesar\\'s funeral .\\nhe was my friend , faithful and just to me .\\nbut brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .\\nhe hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill .\\ndid this in caesar seem ambitious ?\\nwhen that the poor have cried , caesar hath wept .\\nambition should be made of sterner stuff .\\nyet brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .\\nyou all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown , which he did thrice refuse .\\nwas this ambition ?\\ni speak not to disprove what brutus spoke , but here i am to speak what i do know .\\nif thou consider rightly of the matter , caesar has had great wrong .\\nhas he , masters ?\\nhe would not take the crown .\\ntherefore \\'tis certain he was not ambitious .\\nif it be found so , some will dear abide it .\\npoor soul !\\nhis eyes are red as fire with weeping .\\nthere\\'s not a nobler man in rome than antony .\\nbut yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world .\\nnow lies he there , and none so poor to do him reverence .\\no masters , if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , i should do brutus wrong , and cassius wrong , who , you all know , are honorable men .\\ni will not do them wrong .\\ni rather choose to wrong the dead , to wrong myself and you , than i will wrong such honorable men .\\nbut here\\'s a parchment with the seal of caesar .\\nlet but the commons hear this testament , which , pardon me , i do not mean to read , and they would go and kiss dead caesar\\'s wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood , yea , beg a hair of him for memory , and , dying , mention it within their wills , bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue .\\nwe\\'ll hear the will .\\nread it , mark antony !\\nthe will , the will !\\nwe will hear caesar\\'s will .\\nit is not meet you know how caesar loved you .\\nyou are not wood , you are not stones , but men .\\nand , being men , bearing the will of caesar , it will inflame you , it will make you mad .\\nread the will .\\nwe\\'ll hear it , antony .\\nyou shall read us the will , caesar\\'s will .\\nwill you be patient ?\\nwill you stay awhile ?\\ni have o\\'ershot myself to tell you of it .\\ni fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar .\\nthey were traitors !\\nthe testament !\\nthey were villains , murderers .\\nthe will !\\nread the will !\\nyou will compel me , then , to read the will ?\\nthen make a ring about the corpse of caesar , and let me show you him that made the will .\\nshall i descend ?\\nand will you give me leave ?\\ncome down .\\ndescend .\\nyou shall have leave .\\nstand from the hearse .\\nstand from the body .\\nroom for antony , most noble antony !\\nnay , press not so upon me .\\nstand far off .\\nstand back .\\nroom !\\nif you have tears , prepare to shed them now .\\nyou all do know this mantle .\\ni remember the first time ever caesar put it on .\\ntwas on a summer\\'s evening in his tent , that day he overcame the nervii .\\nlook , in this place ran cassius \\' dagger through .\\nsee what a rent the envious casca made .\\nfor brutus , as you know , was caesar\\'s angel .\\njudge , o you gods , how dearly caesar loved him !\\nthis was the most unkindest cut of all .\\nthen burst his mighty heart , and , in his mantle muffling up his face , even at the base of pompey\\'s statue , which all the while ran blood , great caesar fell .\\no , what a fall was there , my countrymen !\\nthen i , and you , and all of us fell down , whilst bloody treason flourished over us .\\noh , now you weep , and , i perceive , you feel the dint of pity .\\nthese are gracious drops .\\nkind souls , what , weep you when you but behold our caesar\\'s vesture wounded ?\\nlook you here , here is himself , marred , as you see , with traitors .\\no piteous spectacle !\\no noble caesar !\\no woeful day !\\no traitors , villains !\\no most bloody sight !\\nabout !\\nseek !\\nburn !\\nfire !\\nkill !\\nslay !\\nstay , countrymen .\\npeace there !\\nhear the noble antony .\\nthey that have done this deed are honorable .\\nwhat private griefs they have , alas , i know not , that made them do it .\\nthey are wise and honorable , and will , no doubt , with reasons answer you .\\ni come not , friends , to steal away your hearts .\\nfor i have neither wit nor words nor worth , action nor utterance nor the power of speech , to stir men\\'s blood .\\ni only speak right on .\\nbut were i brutus , and brutus antony , there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny .\\nwe\\'ll mutiny .\\nwe\\'ll burn the house of brutus .\\naway , then !\\ncome , seek the conspirators .\\nyet hear me , countrymen .\\nyet hear me speak .\\npeace , ho !\\nhear antony .\\nmost noble antony !\\nwhy , friends , you go to do you know not what .\\nwherein hath caesar thus deserved your loves ?\\nalas , you know not .\\ni must tell you then .\\nyou have forgot the will i told you of .\\nmost true .\\nthe will !\\nlet\\'s stay and hear the will .\\nmost noble caesar !\\nwe\\'ll revenge his death .\\no royal caesar !\\nhear me with patience .\\npeace , ho !\\nmoreover , he hath left you all his walks , his private arbors and new-planted orchards , on this side tiber .\\nhe hath left them you and to your heirs forever , common pleasures , to walk abroad and recreate yourselves .\\nhere was a caesar !\\nwhen comes such another ?\\nwe\\'ll burn his body in the holy place , and with the brands fire the traitors \\' houses .\\ntake up the body .\\ngo fetch fire .\\nnow let it work .\\nhow now , fellow ?\\nsir , octavius is already come to rome .\\nwhere is he ?\\nhe and lepidus are at caesar\\'s house .\\nand thither will i straight to visit him .\\nhe comes upon a wish .\\nfortune is merry , and in this mood will give us anything .\\ni heard him say , brutus and cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of rome .\\nbelike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them .\\nbring me to octavius .\\ntis just .\\nand it is very much lamented , brutus , that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow .\\ni have heard where many of the best respect in rome , except immortal caesar , speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this age\\'s yoke , have wished that noble brutus had his eyes .\\ninto what dangers would you lead me , cassius , that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me ?\\ntherefore , good brutus , be prepared to hear .\\nand since you know you can not see yourself so well as by reflection , i , your glass , will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of .\\nand be not jealous on me , gentle brutus .\\nwere i a common laugher , or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester , if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and , after , scandal them , or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout , then hold me dangerous .\\nwhat means this shouting ?\\ni do fear , the people choose caesar for their king .\\nay , do you fear it ?\\nthen must i think you would not have it so .\\ni dreamt tonight that i did feast with caesar , and things unlucky charge my fantasy .\\ni have no will to wander forth of doors , yet something leads me forth .\\nwhat is your name ?\\nwhither are you going ?\\nwhere do you dwell ?\\nare you a married man or a bachelor ?\\nanswer every man directly .\\nay , and briefly .\\nay , and wisely .\\nwhat is my name ?\\nwhither am i going ?\\nwhere do i dwell ?\\nam i a married man or a bachelor ?\\nthen , to answer every man directly and briefly , wisely and truly , wisely i say , i am a bachelor .\\nthat\\'s as much as to say they are fools that marry .\\nyou\\'ll bear me a bang for that , i fear .\\ndirectly , i am going to caesar\\'s funeral .\\nas a friend or an enemy ?\\nas a friend .\\nbriefly , i dwell by the capitol .\\nyour name , sir , truly .\\ntruly , my name is cinna .\\ntear him to pieces .\\nhe\\'s a conspirator .\\ni am not cinna the conspirator .\\nit is no matter .\\nhis name\\'s cinna .\\npluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going .\\ntear him , tear him !\\ncome , brands , ho , firebrands .\\nto brutus \\' , to cassius \\' , burn all .\\nsome to decius \\' house and some to casca\\'s .\\nsome to ligarius \\' .\\naway , go !\\nthese many , then , shall die .\\ntheir names are pricked .\\ni do consent , prick him down , antony .\\nupon condition publius shall not live , who is your sister\\'s son , mark antony .\\nhe shall not live .\\nlook , with a spot i damn him .\\nbut , lepidus , go you to caesar\\'s house .\\nfetch the will hither , and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies .\\nwhat , shall i find you here ?\\nor here , or at the capitol .\\nthis is a slight , unmeritable man , meet to be sent on errands .\\nis it fit , the threefold world divided , he should stand one of the three to share it ?\\noctavius , i have seen more days than you .\\nand though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads , he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold , to groan and sweat under the business , either led or driven , as we point the way .\\nand having brought our treasure where we will , then take we down his load and turn him off , like to the empty ass , to shake his ears and graze in commons .\\nyou may do your will , but he\\'s a tried and valiant soldier .\\nso is my horse , octavius , and for that i do appoint him store of provender .\\nstand , ho !\\ngive the word , ho , and stand .\\nwhat now , lucillius ?\\nis cassius near ?\\nhe is at hand , and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master .\\nbut if he be at hand i shall be satisfied .\\nhe is not doubted. , a word , lucillius .\\nbut not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old .\\nthou hast described a hot friend cooling .\\nthere are no tricks in plain and simple faith .\\nbut hollow men , like horses hot at hand , make gallant show and promise of their mettle .\\nbut when they should endure the bloody spur , they fall their crests and , like deceitful jades , sink in the trial .\\ncomes his army on ?\\nthey mean this night in sardis to be quartered .\\nthe greater part , the horse in general , are come with cassius .\\nhark !\\nhe is arrived .\\nmarch gently on to meet him .\\nstand , ho !\\nstand , ho !\\nspeak the word along .\\nstand !\\nstand !\\nstand !\\nmost noble brother , you have done me wrong .\\njudge me , you gods !\\nwrong i mine enemies ?\\nand when you do them , cassius , be content .\\nbefore the eyes of both our armies here , which should perceive nothing but love from us , let us not wrangle .\\nbid them move away .\\nthen in my tent , cassius , enlarge your griefs , and i will give you audience .\\npindarus , bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground .\\nlet lucius and titinius guard our door .\\nthat you have wronged me doth appear in this : you have condemned and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians , wherein my letters , praying on his side because i knew the man , were slighted off .\\nyou wronged yourself to write in such a case .\\nin such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment .\\nlet me tell you , cassius , you yourself are much condemned to have an itching palm , to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers .\\ni \"an itching palm\" !\\nyou know that you are brutus that speak this , or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .\\nthe name of cassius honors this corruption , and chastisement doth therefore hide his head .\\nchastisement !\\nremember march , the ides of march remember .\\ndid not great julius bleed for justice \\' sake ?\\nwhat villain touched his body , that did stab , and not for justice ?\\nwhat , shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers , shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes , and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be grasped thus ?\\ni had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman .\\nbrutus , bait not me .\\ni\\'ll not endure it .\\nyou forget yourself to hedge me in .\\ni am a soldier , i , older in practice , abler than yourself to make conditions .\\ngo to .\\nyou are not , cassius .\\ni am .\\ni say you are not .\\nurge me no more , i shall forget myself .\\nhave mind upon your health , tempt me no further .\\naway , slight man !\\nis \\'t possible ?\\nhear me , for i will speak .\\nshall i be frighted when a madman stares ?\\nbut wherefore do you hold me here so long ?\\nwhat is it that you would impart to me ?\\ni know that virtue to be in you , brutus , as well as i do know your outward favor .\\nwell , honor is the subject of my story .\\ni can not tell what you and other men think of this life , but , for my single self , i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself .\\ni was born free as caesar .\\nso were you .\\nwe both have fed as well , and we can both endure the winter\\'s cold as well as he .\\nfor once upon a raw and gusty day , the troubled tiber chafing with her shores , caesar said to me , \"darest thou , cassius , now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point ? \" upon the word , accoutred as i was , i plunged in and bade him follow .\\nso indeed he did .\\nbut ere we could arrive the point proposed , caesar cried , \"help me , cassius , or i sink ! \" i , as aeneas , our great ancestor , did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear , so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar .\\nall this\" ?\\nay , more .\\nfret till your proud heart break .\\ngo show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble .\\nis it come to this ?\\nyou say you are a better soldier .\\nlet it appear so .\\nmake your vaunting true , and it shall please me well .\\nfor mine own part , i shall be glad to learn of noble men .\\nyou wrong me every way .\\nyou wrong me , brutus .\\nwhen caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .\\npeace , peace !\\nyou durst not so have tempted him .\\ni durst not !\\nno .\\nfor your life you durst not .\\ndo not presume too much upon my love .\\ni may do that i shall be sorry for .\\nyou have done that you should be sorry for .\\nthere is no terror , cassius , in your threats , for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind , which i respect not .\\ni did send to you for gold to pay my legions , which you denied me .\\nwas that done like cassius ?\\nshould i have answered caius cassius so ?\\ni denied you not .\\nyou did .\\ni did not .\\nhe was but a fool that brought my answer back .\\nbrutus hath rived my heart .\\na friend should bear his friend\\'s infirmities , but brutus makes mine greater than they are .\\ni do not , till you practice them on me .\\nyou love me not .\\ni do not like your faults .\\na friendly eye could never see such faults .\\na flatterer\\'s would not , though they do appear as huge as high olympus .\\noh , i could weep my spirit from mine eyes .\\nsheathe your dagger .\\nbe angry when you will , it shall have scope .\\ndo what you will , dishonor shall be humor .\\nwhen i spoke that , i was ill-tempered too .\\ndo you confess so much ?\\ngive me your hand .\\nand my heart too .\\no brutus !\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nhave not you love enough to bear with me , when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful ?\\nyes , cassius .\\nand from henceforth when you are over-earnest with your brutus , he\\'ll think your mother chides and leave you so .\\nhow now ?\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nfor shame , you generals !\\nwhat do you mean ?\\nlove , and be friends as two such men should be .\\nfor i have seen more years , i\\'m sure , than ye .\\nbear with him , brutus .\\ntis his fashion .\\ni\\'ll know his humor when he knows his time .\\nwhat should the wars do with these jigging fools ?\\ncompanion , hence !\\naway , away , be gone .\\nlucillius and titinius , bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight .\\nand come yourselves , and bring messala with you , immediately to us .\\ni did not think you could have been so angry .\\no cassius , i am sick of many griefs .\\nportia is dead .\\nha , portia ?\\nshe is dead .\\no insupportable and touching loss !\\nupon what sickness ?\\nimpatient of my absence , and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong , for with her death that tidings came , with this she fell distract and , her attendants absent , swallowed fire .\\nand died so ?\\neven so .\\no ye immortal gods !\\nmy heart is thirsty for that noble pledge .\\nfill , lucius , till the wine o\\'erswell the cup .\\ni can not drink too much of brutus \\' love .\\nnow sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities .\\nportia , art thou gone ?\\nno more , i pray you .\\nmessala , i have here received letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power , bending their expedition toward philippi .\\nmyself have letters of the selfsame tenor .\\nwith what addition ?\\nthat by proscription and bills of outlawry , octavius , antony , and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators .\\ntherein our letters do not well agree .\\nmine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions , cicero being one .\\ncicero one ?\\ncicero is dead , and by that order of proscription .\\nno , messala .\\nnor nothing in your letters writ of her ?\\nnothing , messala .\\nthat methinks is strange .\\nwhy ask you ?\\nhear you aught of her in yours ?\\nno , my lord .\\nnow , as you are a roman , tell me true .\\nthen like a roman bear the truth i tell .\\nfor certain she is dead , and by strange manner .\\nwhy , farewell , portia .\\nwe must die , messala .\\nwith meditating that she must die once , i have the patience to endure it now .\\neven so great men great losses should endure .\\ni have as much of this in art as you , but yet my nature could not bear it so .\\nwell , to our work alive .\\nwhat do you think of marching to philippi presently ?\\ni do not think it good .\\nyour reason ?\\nthis it is : \\'t is better that the enemy seek us .\\nso shall he waste his means , weary his soldiers , doing himself offense , whilst we , lying still , are full of rest , defense , and nimbleness .\\nthe enemy , marching along by them , by them shall make a fuller number up , come on refreshed , new-added , and encouraged , from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there , these people at our back .\\nhear me , good brother , under your pardon .\\nyou must note beside , that we have tried the utmost of our friends , our legions are brim-full , our cause is ripe .\\nthe enemy increaseth every day .\\nwe , at the height , are ready to decline .\\non such a full sea are we now afloat , and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures .\\nthen , with your will , go on .\\nwe\\'ll along ourselves , and meet them at philippi .\\nthe deep of night is crept upon our talk , and nature must obey necessity , which we will niggard with a little rest .\\nthere is no more to say ?\\nno more .\\ngood night .\\nearly tomorrow will we rise and hence .\\nlucius !\\nnever come such division \\'tween our souls .\\nlet it not , brutus .\\nis now become a god , and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him .\\nhe had a fever when he was in spain , and when the fit was on him , i did mark how he did shake .\\ntis true , this god did shake !\\nhis coward lips did from their color fly , and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster .\\ni did hear him groan , ay , and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books , \"alas , \" it cried , \"give me some drink , titinius , \" as a sick girl .\\nye gods , it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone .\\nanother general shout !\\ni do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heaped on caesar .\\nwhy , man , he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves .\\nmen at some time are masters of their fates .\\nthe fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars but in ourselves , that we are underlings .\\nbrutus and caesar , what should be in that \"caesar\" ?\\nwhy should that name be sounded more than yours ?\\nwrite them together , yours is as fair a name .\\nsound them , it doth become the mouth as well .\\neverything is well .\\ngood night , my lord .\\ngood night , good brother .\\ngood night , lord brutus .\\nfarewell , everyone .\\ngive me the gown .\\nwhere is thy instrument ?\\nhere in the tent .\\nwhat , thou speak\\'st drowsily ?\\ncall claudio and some other of my men .\\ni\\'ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .\\nvarrus and claudio !\\ncalls my lord ?\\ni pray you , sirs , lie in my tent and sleep .\\nit may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius .\\nso please you , we will stand and watch your pleasure .\\nlook , lucius , here\\'s the book i sought for so .\\ni put it in the pocket of my gown .\\ni was sure your lordship did not give it me .\\ncanst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile , and touch thy instrument a strain or two ?\\nay , my lord , an \\'t please you .\\nit does , my boy .\\ni trouble thee too much , but thou art willing .\\nit is my duty , sir .\\ni should not urge thy duty past thy might .\\ni know young bloods look for a time of rest .\\ni have slept , my lord , already .\\nit was well done , and thou shalt sleep again .\\ni will not hold thee long .\\nif i do live , i will be good to thee .\\nthis is a sleepy tune .\\no murderous slumber , layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy that plays thee music ? , gentle knave , good night .\\ni will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee .\\nand , good boy , good night .\\nlet me see , let me see .\\nis not the leaf turned down where i left reading ?\\nhere it is , i think .\\ni think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition .\\nit comes upon me. , art thou any thing ?\\nart thou some god , some angel , or some devil that makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ?\\nspeak to me what thou art .\\nthy evil spirit , brutus .\\nwhy comest thou ?\\nto tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi .\\nwell , then i shall see thee again ?\\nay , at philippi .\\nwhy , i will see thee at philippi , then .\\nill spirit , i would hold more talk with thee .\\nclaudio !\\nthe strings , my lord , are false .\\nhe thinks he still is at his instrument .\\nlucius , awake .\\nmy lord ?\\ndidst thou dream , lucius , that thou so criedst out ?\\nmy lord , i do not know that i did cry .\\nyes , that thou didst .\\ndidst thou see any thing ?\\nnothing , my lord .\\nmy lord ?\\nmy lord ?\\nwhy did you so cry out , sirs , in your sleep ?\\ndid we , my lord ?\\nay .\\nsaw you anything ?\\nno , my lord , i saw nothing .\\nnor i , my lord .\\ngo and commend me to my brother cassius .\\nbid him set on his powers betimes before , and we will follow .\\nit shall be done , my lord .\\nnow , antony , our hopes are answered .\\nyou said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions .\\nit proves not so .\\ntheir battles are at hand .\\nthey mean to warn us at philippi here , answering before we do demand of them .\\ntut , i am in their bosoms , and i know wherefore they do it .\\nthey could be content to visit other places , and come down with fearful bravery , thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage .\\nbut \\'tis not so .\\nprepare you , generals .\\nthe enemy comes on in gallant show .\\ntheir bloody sign of battle is hung out , and something to be done immediately .\\noctavius , lead your battle softly on , upon the left hand of the even field .\\nupon the right hand i .\\nkeep thou the left .\\nwhy do you cross me in this exigent ?\\nthey stand and would have parley .\\nstand fast , titinius .\\nwe must out and talk .\\nmark antony , shall we give sign of battle ?\\nno , caesar , we will answer on their charge .\\nmake forth .\\nthe generals would have some words .\\nwords before blows .\\nis it so , countrymen ?\\nnot that we love words better , as you do .\\ngood words are better than bad strokes , octavius .\\nin your bad strokes , brutus , you give good words .\\nbut for your words , they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless .\\nnot stingless too ?\\nvillains , you did not so when your vile daggers hacked one another in the sides of caesar .\\nflatterers ? , now , brutus , thank yourself .\\nwhen think you that the sword goes up again ?\\nnever , till caesar\\'s three and thirty wounds be well avenged , or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors .\\ncaesar , thou canst not die by traitors \\' hands unless thou bring\\'st them with thee .\\nso i hope .\\ni was not born to die on brutus \\' sword .\\no , if thou wert the noblest of thy strain , young man , thou couldst not die more honorable .\\na peevish schoolboy , worthless of such honor , joined with a masker and a reveler !\\nold cassius still .\\nif you dare fight today , come to the field .\\nif not , when you have stomachs .\\nwhy , now , blow wind , swell billow , and swim bark !\\nthe storm is up and all is on the hazard .\\nmessala !\\nmessala , this is my birthday , as this very day was cassius born .\\ngive me thy hand , messala .\\nbe thou my witness that against my will , as pompey was , am i compelled to set upon one battle all our liberties .\\nyou know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion .\\nnow i change my mind , and partly credit things that do presage .\\ncoming from sardis , on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell , and there they perched , gorging and feeding from our soldiers \\' hands , who to philippi here consorted us .\\nthis morning are they fled away and gone , and in their steads do ravens , crows , and kites fly o\\'er our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey .\\ntheir shadows seem a canopy most fatal , under which our army lies , ready to give up the ghost .\\nbelieve not so .\\ni but believe it partly , for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly .\\nnow , most noble brutus , the gods today stand friendly that we may , lovers in peace , lead on our days to age .\\nbut since the affairs of men rest still incertain , let\\'s reason with the worst that may befall .\\nif we do lose this battle , then is this the very last time we shall speak together .\\nwhat are you then determined to do ?\\nbrutus\" will start a spirit as soon as \"caesar.\" now in the names of all the gods at once , upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great ?\\nage , thou art shamed !\\nrome , thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !\\nwhen went there by an age , since the great flood , but it was famed with more than with one man ?\\nwhen could they say till now , that talked of rome , that her wide walks encompassed but one man ?\\nnow is it rome indeed , and room enough , when there is in it but one only man .\\noh , you and i have heard our fathers say , there was a brutus once that would have brooked th \\' eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king .\\nthat you do love me , i am nothing jealous .\\nwhat you would work me to , i have some aim .\\nhow i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter .\\nfor this present , i would not , so with love i might entreat you , be any further moved .\\nwhat you have said i will consider , what you have to say i will with patience hear , and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things .\\ntill then , my noble friend , chew upon this : brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us .\\ni am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus .\\nthen if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome ?\\nno , cassius , no .\\nthink not , thou noble roman , that ever brutus will go bound to rome .\\nhe bears too great a mind .\\ntherefore our everlasting farewell take .\\nforever and forever farewell , cassius .\\nif we do meet again , why , we shall smile .\\nif not , why then this parting was well made .\\nforever and forever farewell , brutus .\\nif we do meet again , we\\'ll smile indeed .\\nif not , \\'tis true this parting was well made .\\nwhy then , lead on .\\noh , that a man might know the end of this day\\'s business ere it come !\\nbut it sufficeth that the day will end , and then the end is known. , come , ho !\\naway !\\nride , ride , messala , ride , and give these bills unto the legions on the other side .\\nlet them set on at once , for i perceive but cold demeanor in octavius \\' wing , and sudden push gives them the overthrow .\\nride , ride , messala .\\nmyself have to mine own turned enemy .\\no cassius , brutus gave the word too early , who , having some advantage on octavius , took it too eagerly .\\nfly further off , my lord , fly further off .\\nmark antony is in your tents , my lord .\\nfly , therefore , noble cassius , fly far off .\\nare those my tents where i perceive the fire ?\\nthey are , my lord .\\ntitinius , if thou lovest me , mount thou my horse , and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again , that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy .\\ni will be here again , even with a thought .\\ngo , pindarus , get higher on that hill .\\nmy sight was ever thick .\\nregard titinius , and tell me what thou notest about the field .\\nthis day i breathed first .\\ntime is come round , and where i did begin , there shall i end .\\nmy life is run his compass .\\nwhat news ?\\nand , hark !\\nthey shout for joy .\\ncome down , behold no more .\\noh , coward that i am , to live so long to see my best friend ta\\'en before my face !\\ncome hither , sirrah .\\ncome now , keep thine oath .\\ncaesar , thou art revenged , even with the sword that killed thee .\\nso i am free .\\nyet would not so have been , durst i have done my will .\\no cassius , far from this country pindarus shall run , where never roman shall take note of him .\\nit is but change , titinius , for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus \\' power , as cassius \\' legions are by antony .\\nthese tidings will well comfort cassius .\\nwhere did you leave him ?\\nall disconsolate , with pindarus his bondman on this hill .\\nis not that he that lies upon the ground ?\\nhe lies not like the living .\\no my heart !\\nis not that he ?\\nwhat , pindarus !\\nwhere art thou , pindarus ?\\nseek him , titinius , whilst i go to meet the noble brutus , thrusting this report into his ears .\\ni may say \"thrusting\" it , for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight .\\nhie you , messala , and i will seek for pindarus the while .\\nwhy didst thou send me forth , brave cassius ?\\ndid i not meet thy friends ?\\nand did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee ?\\ndidst thou not hear their shouts ?\\nalas , thou hast misconstrued everything !\\nbut , hold thee , take this garland on thy brow .\\nthy brutus bid me give it thee , and i will do his bidding .\\nwhere , where , messala , doth his body lie ?\\nlo , yonder , and titinius mourning it .\\ntitinius \\' face is upward .\\nhe is slain .\\no julius caesar , thou art mighty yet !\\nthy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords in our own proper entrails .\\nare yet two romans living such as these ?\\nthe last of all the romans , fare thee well !\\ni shall find time , cassius , i shall find time .\\ncome , therefore , and to thasos send his body .\\nlet us to the field .\\nlabio and flavio , set our battles on .\\ntis three o\\'clock , and , romans , yet ere night we shall try fortune in a second fight .\\nwhat bastard doth not ?\\nwho will go with me ?\\ni will proclaim my name about the field .\\ni am the son of marcus cato , ho !\\na foe to tyrants , and my country\\'s friend .\\ni am the son of marcus cato , ho !\\nand i am brutus , marcus brutus , i !\\nbrutus , my country\\'s friend .\\nknow me for brutus !\\no young and noble cato , art thou down ?\\nonly i yield to die .\\nthere is so much that thou wilt kill me straight .\\nkill brutus , and be honored in his death .\\nwe must not .\\na noble prisoner !\\nroom , ho !\\ntell antony brutus is ta\\'en .\\ni\\'ll tell the news .\\nwhere is he ?\\nsafe , antony .\\ni dare assure thee that no enemy shall ever take alive the noble brutus .\\nthe gods defend him from so great a shame !\\nthe games are done and caesar is returning .\\nas they pass by , pluck casca by the sleeve , and he will , after his sour fashion , tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today .\\ni will do so .\\nbut , look you , cassius , the angry spot doth glow on caesar\\'s brow , and all the rest look like a chidden train .\\ncalphurnia\\'s cheek is pale , and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossed in conference by some senators .\\ncasca will tell us what the matter is .\\nantonio .\\ncaesar .\\ncome , poor remains of friends , rest on this rock .\\nstatilius showed the torchlight but , my lord , he came not back .\\nhe is or ta\\'en or slain .\\nsit thee down , clitus .\\nhark thee , clitus .\\nwhat , i , my lord ?\\nno , not for all the world .\\npeace then !\\nno words .\\ni\\'ll rather kill myself .\\nhark thee , dardanius .\\nshall i do such a deed ?\\no dardanius !\\no clitus !\\ncome hither , good volumnius .\\nlist a word .\\nwhat says my lord ?\\nat sardis once , and this last night here in philippi fields .\\ni know my hour is come .\\nnot so , my lord .\\nnay , i am sure it is , volumnius .\\nthou seest the world , volumnius , how it goes .\\nour enemies have beat us to the pit .\\nit is more worthy to leap in ourselves than tarry till they push us .\\ngood volumnius , thou know\\'st that we two went to school together .\\neven for that our love of old , i prithee , hold thou my sword hilts , whilst i run on it .\\nthat\\'s not an office for a friend , my lord .\\nfly , fly , my lord .\\nthere is no tarrying here .\\nfarewell to you. , and you. , and you , volumnius .\\nstrato , thou hast been all this while asleep .\\ni shall have glory by this losing day more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto .\\nso fare you well at once , for brutus \\' tongue hath almost ended his life\\'s history .\\nnight hangs upon mine eyes .\\nmy bones would rest , that have but labored to attain this hour .\\nfly , my lord , fly .\\nhence .\\ni will follow .\\ni prithee , strato , stay thou by thy lord .\\nthou art a fellow of a good respect .\\nthy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .\\nhold then my sword and turn away thy face while i do run upon it .\\nwilt thou , strato ?\\ngive me your hand first .\\nfarewell , good strato .\\nwhat man is that ?\\nfree from the bondage you are in , messala .\\nall that served brutus , i will entertain them .\\nfellow , wilt thou bestow thy time with me ?\\nay , if messala will prefer me to you .\\ndo so , good messala .\\nhow died my master , strato ?\\ni held the sword and he did run on it .\\noctavius , then take him to follow thee , that did the latest service to my master .\\nthis was the noblest roman of them all .\\nall the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar .\\nhe only in a general honest thought and common good to all , made one of them .\\nhis life was gentle , and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world , \"this was a man.\" according to his virtue let us use him , with all respect and rites of burial .\\nwithin my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier , ordered honorably .\\nso call the field to rest , and let\\'s away to part the glories of this happy day .\\nay , casca .\\ntell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad .\\nwhy , you were with him , were you not ?\\ni should not then ask casca what had chanced .\\nwhy , there was a crown offered him ; and , being offered him , he put it by with the back of his hand , thus ; and then the people fell a-shouting .\\nwhat was the second noise for ?\\nwhy , for that too .\\nthey shouted thrice .\\nwhat was the last cry for ?\\nwhy , for that too .\\nwas the crown offered him thrice ?\\nay , marry , was \\'t , and he put it by thrice , every time gentler than other , and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted .\\nwho offered him the crown ?\\nwhy , antony .\\ntell us the manner of it , gentle casca .\\ni can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it .\\ni saw mark antony offer him a crown ( yet \\'twas not a crown neither , \\'twas one of these coronets ) and , as i told you , he put it by once , but , for all that , to my thinking , he would fain have had it .\\nthen he offered it to him again , then he put it by again , but , to my thinking , he was very loath to lay his fingers off it .\\nand then he offered it the third time .\\nand for mine own part , i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air .\\nbut soft , i pray you .\\nwhat , did caesar swoon ?\\nhe fell down in the marketplace , and foamed at mouth , and was speechless .\\ntis very like .\\nhe hath the falling sickness .\\nno , caesar hath it not .\\nbut you and i and honest casca , we have the falling sickness .\\ni know not what you mean by that , but i am sure caesar fell down .\\nwhat said he when he came unto himself ?\\nmarry , before he fell down , when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown , he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut .\\nan i had been a man of any occupation , if i would not have taken him at a word , i would i might go to hell among the rogues .\\nand so he fell .\\nwhen he came to himself again , he said , if he had done or said anything amiss , he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .\\nthree or four wenches where i stood cried , \"alas , good soul ! \" and forgave him with all their hearts .\\nif caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less .\\nand after that he came thus sad away ?\\nay .\\nhence !\\nhome , you idle creatures get you home !\\nis this a holiday ?\\nwhy , sir , a carpenter .\\nwhere is thy leather apron and thy rule ?\\nwhat dost thou with thy best apparel on ?\\ntruly , sir , in respect of a fine workman , i am but , as you would say , a cobbler .\\nbut what trade art thou ?\\nanswer me directly .\\na trade , sir , that i hope i may use with a safe conscience , which is , indeed , sir , a mender of bad soles .\\nwhat trade , thou knave ?\\nthou naughty knave , what trade ?\\nnay , i beseech you , sir , be not out with me .\\nyet , if you be out , sir , i can mend you .\\nwhat mean\\'st thou by that ?\\nmend\" me , thou saucy fellow ?\\ndid cicero say anything ?\\nay , he spoke greek .\\nto what effect ?\\nnay , an i tell you that , i\\'ll ne\\'er look you i \\' th \\' face again .\\nbut those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .\\nbut , for mine own part , it was greek to me .\\ni could tell you more news too .\\nmurellus and flavius , for pulling scarfs off caesar\\'s images , are put to silence .\\nfare you well .\\nthere was more foolery yet , if i could remember it .\\nwill you sup with me tonight , casca ?\\nno , i am promised forth .\\nwill you dine with me tomorrow ?\\nay , if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating .\\ngood .\\ni will expect you .\\ndo so .\\nfarewell both .\\nwhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be !\\nhe was quick mettle when he went to school .\\nso is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise , however he puts on this tardy form .\\nthis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit , which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite .\\nand so it is .\\nfor this time i will leave you .\\ntomorrow , if you please to speak with me , i will come home to you .\\nor , if you will , come home to me , and i will wait for you .\\ni will do so .\\ntill then , think of the world .\\nwell , brutus , thou art noble .\\ncaesar doth bear me hard , but he loves brutus .\\nif i were brutus now and he were cassius , he should not humor me .\\ni will this night , in several hands , in at his windows throw , as if they came from several citizens , writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name , wherein obscurely caesar\\'s ambition shall be glanced at .\\nbrought you caesar home ?\\no cicero , i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks , and i have seen th \\' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds , but never till tonight , never till now , did i go through a tempest dropping fire .\\neither there is a civil strife in heaven , or else the world , too saucy with the gods , incenses them to send destruction .\\nbesides , i ha \\' not since put up my sword , against the capitol i met a lion , who glared upon me and went surly by , without annoying me .\\nand there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women , transformed with their fear , who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets .\\nand yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noon-day upon the marketplace , hooting and shrieking .\\nwhen these prodigies do so conjointly meet , let not men say , \"these are their reasons .\\nthey are natural.\" for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon .\\nindeed , it is a strange-disposed time .\\nbut men may construe things after their fashion , clean from the purpose of the things themselves .\\ncomes caesar to the capitol tomorrow ?\\nhe doth , for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow .\\ngood night then , casca .\\nthis disturbed sky is not to walk in .\\na roman .\\ncasca , by your voice .\\nyour ear is good .\\ncassius , what night is this !\\na very pleasing night to honest men .\\nwho ever knew the heavens menace so ?\\nthose that have known the earth so full of faults .\\nfor my part , i have walked about the streets , submitting me unto the perilous night , and , thus unbraced , casca , as you see , have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone .\\nand when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of heaven , i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it .\\nbut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens ?\\nit is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us .\\nyou are dull , casca , and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want , or else you use not .\\nyou look pale , and gaze , and put on fear , and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens .\\na man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action , yet prodigious grown , and fearful as these strange eruptions are .\\nlet it be who it is .\\nour yoke and sufferance show us womanish .\\nindeed , they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king , and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy .\\ni know where i will wear this dagger then .\\ncassius from bondage will deliver cassius .\\ntherein , ye gods , you make the weak most strong .\\ntherein , ye gods , you tyrants do defeat .\\nnor stony tower , nor walls of beaten brass , nor airless dungeon , nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit .\\nbut life , being weary of these worldly bars , never lacks power to dismiss itself .\\nif i know this , know all the world besides , that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure .\\nso can i .\\nso every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity .\\nand why should caesar be a tyrant then ?\\npoor man !\\ni know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep .\\nhe were no lion were not romans hinds .\\nthose that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws .\\nbut , o grief , where hast thou led me ?\\nthen i know my answer must be made .\\nyou speak to casca , and to such a man that is no fleering telltale .\\nhold , my hand .\\nbe factious for redress of all these griefs , and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest .\\nthere\\'s a bargain made .\\nnow know you , casca , i have moved already some certain of the noblest-minded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorable-dangerous consequence .\\nand i do know by this they stay for me in pompey\\'s porch .\\ntis cinna .\\ni do know him by his gait .\\nto find out you .\\nwho\\'s that ?\\nmetellus cimber ?\\nno , it is casca , one incorporate to our attempts .\\nam i not stayed for , cinna ?\\ni am glad on \\'t .\\nwhat a fearful night is this !\\nthere\\'s two or three of us have seen strange sights .\\nam i not stayed for ?\\ntell me .\\nyes , you are .\\no cassius , if you could but win the noble brutus to our party , be you content .\\ngood cinna , take this paper , and look you lay it in the praetor\\'s chair where brutus may but find it .\\nall this done , repair to pompey\\'s porch , where you shall find us .\\nis decius brutus and trebonius there ?\\nall but metellus cimber , and he\\'s gone to seek you at your house .\\nwell , i will hie , and so bestow these papers as you bade me .\\nthat done , repair to pompey\\'s theatre .\\ncome , casca , you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house .\\nhim and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited .\\nlet us go , for it is after midnight , and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him .\\nawake , i say !\\nwhat , lucius !\\ncalled you , my lord ?\\nget me a taper in my study , lucius .\\nwhen it is lighted , come and call me here .\\ni will , my lord .\\nit must be by his death , and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general .\\nhe would be crowned .\\nhow that might change his nature , there\\'s the question .\\nit is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking .\\ncrown him that , and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with .\\nwhy , sir , cobble you .\\nthou art a cobbler , art thou ?\\ntruly , sir , all that i live by is with the awl .\\ni meddle with no tradesman\\'s matters nor women\\'s matters , but withal i am indeed , sir , a surgeon to old shoes .\\nwhen they are in great danger , i recover them .\\nas proper men as ever trod upon neat\\'s leather have gone upon my handiwork .\\nbut wherefore art not in thy shop today ?\\nwhy dost thou lead these men about the streets ?\\ntruly , sir , to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work .\\nwherefore rejoice ?\\nwhat conquest brings he home ?\\nwhat tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?\\nth \\' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power .\\nso caesar may .\\nthen , lest he may , prevent .\\nand since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is , fashion it thus : that what he is , augmented , would run to these and these extremities .\\nthe taper burneth in your closet , sir .\\nsearching the window for a flint , i found this paper , thus sealed up , and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed .\\nget you to bed again .\\nit is not day .\\nis not tomorrow , boy , the ides of march ?\\ni know not , sir .\\nlook in the calendar and bring me word .\\ni will , sir .\\nsir , march is wasted fifteen days .\\ntis good .\\ngo to the gate .\\nsomebody knocks .\\nsince cassius first did whet me against caesar , i have not slept .\\nis he alone ?\\ndo you know them ?\\nlet \\'em enter .\\no conspiracy , shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free ?\\no , then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage ?\\nhide it in smiles and affability .\\ni think we are too bold upon your rest .\\ngood morrow , brutus .\\ndo we trouble you ?\\ni have been up this hour , awake all night .\\nknow i these men that come along with you ?\\nthis is trebonius .\\nhe is welcome hither .\\nthis , decius brutus .\\nhe is welcome too .\\nthis , casca .\\nthis , cinna .\\nand this , metellus cimber .\\nthey are all welcome .\\nwhat watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night ?\\nshall i entreat a word ?\\nhere lies the east .\\ndoth not the day break here ?\\nno .\\nyou shall confess that you are both deceived .\\nand let us swear our resolution .\\nno , not an oath .\\nso let high-sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery .\\nbut if these , as i am sure they do , bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women , then , countrymen , what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress ?\\nwhat other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter ?\\nand what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged , that this shall be , or we will fall for it ?\\nswear priests and cowards and men cautelous , old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs .\\nunto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt .\\nbut do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise , nor th \\' insuppressive mettle of our spirits , to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath , when every drop of blood that every roman bears , and nobly bears , is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passed from him .\\nbut what of cicero ?\\nshall we sound him ?\\ni think he will stand very strong with us .\\nlet us not leave him out .\\nno , by no means .\\no , let us have him , for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy men\\'s voices to commend our deeds .\\nit shall be said his judgment ruled our hands .\\no , name him not .\\nlet us not break with him , for he will never follow anything that other men begin .\\nthen leave him out .\\nindeed he is not fit .\\ndecius , well urged .\\ni think it is not meet mark antony , so well beloved of caesar , should outlive caesar .\\nwe shall find of him a shrewd contriver .\\nand , you know , his means , if he improve them , may well stretch so far as to annoy us all ; which to prevent , let antony and caesar fall together .\\nour course will seem too bloody , caius cassius , to cut the head off and then hack the limbs , like wrath in death and envy afterwards , for antony is but a limb of caesar .\\nlet us be sacrificers but not butchers , caius .\\nwe all stand up against the spirit of caesar , and in the spirit of men there is no blood .\\noh , that we then could come by caesar\\'s spirit and not dismember caesar !\\nbut , alas , caesar must bleed for it .\\nand , gentle friends , let\\'s kill him boldly but not wrathfully .\\nlet\\'s carve him as a dish fit for the gods , not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds .\\nand let our hearts , as subtle masters do , stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide \\'em .\\nthis shall make our purpose necessary and not envious , which so appearing to the common eyes , we shall be called purgers , not murderers .\\nif he love caesar , all that he can do is to himself : take thought and die for caesar .\\nand that were much he should , for he is given to sports , to wildness and much company .\\nthere is no fear in him .\\npeace !\\ncount the clock .\\nthe clock hath stricken three .\\ntis time to part .\\nit may be , these apparent prodigies , the unaccustomed terror of this night , and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today .\\nnever fear that .\\nif he be so resolved , i can o\\'ersway him .\\nfor he loves to hear that unicorns may be betrayed with trees , and bears with glasses , elephants with holes , lions with toils , and men with flatterers .\\nbut when i tell him he hates flatterers , he says he does , being then most flattered .\\nlet me work .\\nfor i can give his humor the true bent , and i will bring him to the capitol .\\nnay , we will all of us be there to fetch him .\\nby the eighth hour .\\nis that the uttermost ?\\ncaius ligarius doth bear caesar hard , who rated him for speaking well of pompey .\\ni wonder none of you have thought of him .\\nnow , good metellus , go along by him .\\nhe loves me well , and i have given him reasons .\\nsend him but hither and i\\'ll fashion him .\\nthe morning comes upon \\'s .\\nwe\\'ll leave you , brutus .\\nand , friends , disperse yourselves .\\nbut all remember what you have said , and show yourselves true romans .\\ngood gentlemen , look fresh and merrily .\\nand so good morrow to you every one .\\nboy !\\nlucius ! , fast asleep ?\\nit is no matter .\\nenjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber .\\ntherefore thou sleep\\'st so sound .\\nbrutus , my lord .\\nportia , what mean you ?\\nit is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw , cold morning .\\nnor for yours neither .\\ny \\' have ungently , brutus , stole from my bed .\\nand yesternight , at supper , you suddenly arose and walked about , musing and sighing , with your arms across , and when i asked you what the matter was , you stared upon me with ungentle looks .\\ni urged you further , then you scratched your head and too impatiently stamped with your foot .\\nyet i insisted ; yet you answered not , but with an angry wafture of your hand gave sign for me to leave you .\\ndear my lord , make me acquainted with your cause of grief .\\nand do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompey\\'s blood ?\\nbe gone !\\nrun to your houses , fall upon your knees , pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude .\\ngo , go , good countrymen , and for this fault , assemble all the poor men of your sort , draw them to tiber banks , and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all .\\ngo you down that way towards the capitol .\\nthis way will i. disrobe the images if you do find them decked with ceremonies .\\nmay we do so ?\\ni\\'ll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets .\\nso do you too , where you perceive them thick .\\nthese growing feathers plucked from caesar\\'s wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch , who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness .\\ni am not well in health , and that is all .\\nbrutus is wise , and were he not in health , he would embrace the means to come by it .\\nwhy , so i do .\\ngood portia , go to bed .\\nis brutus sick ?\\nand is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humors of the dank morning ?\\nwhat , is brutus sick , and will he steal out of his wholesome bed , to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness ?\\nkneel not , gentle portia .\\nyou are my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart .\\nif this were true , then should i know this secret .\\ni grant i am a woman , but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife .\\ni grant i am a woman , but withal a woman well-reputed , cato\\'s daughter .\\nthink you i am no stronger than my sex , being so fathered and so husbanded ?\\ntell me your counsels .\\ni will not disclose \\'em .\\ni have made strong proof of my constancy , giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh .\\ncan i bear that with patience , and not my husband\\'s secrets ?\\no ye gods , render me worthy of this noble wife !\\nhark , hark !\\none knocks .\\nleave me with haste .\\nlucius , who\\'s that knocking ?\\nhe is a sick man that would speak with you .\\nwould you were not sick !\\ni am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honor .\\nsuch an exploit have i in hand , ligarius , had you a healthful ear to hear of it .\\na piece of work that will make sick men whole .\\nbut are not some whole that we must make sick ?\\nthat must we also .\\nwhat it is , my caius , i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done .\\nfollow me , then .\\nnor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight .\\nthrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out , \"help , ho !\\nthey murder caesar ! \" , who\\'s within ?\\nmy lord .\\ngo bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success .\\ni will , my lord .\\nwhat mean you , caesar ?\\nthink you to walk forth ?\\nyou shall not stir out of your house today .\\ncaesar shall forth .\\nthe things that threatened me ne\\'er looked but on my back .\\nwhen they shall see the face of caesar , they are vanished .\\ncaesar , i never stood on ceremonies , yet now they fright me .\\nthere is one within , besides the things that we have heard and seen , recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch .\\na lioness hath whelped in the streets , and graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .\\nfierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war , which drizzled blood upon the capitol .\\no caesar !\\nthese things are beyond all use , and i do fear them .\\nwhat can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods ?\\nyet caesar shall go forth , for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar .\\nwhen beggars die there are no comets seen .\\nthe heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes .\\ncowards die many times before their deaths .\\nthe valiant never taste of death but once .\\nof all the wonders that i yet have heard , it seems to me most strange that men should fear , seeing that death , a necessary end , will come when it will come .\\nwhat say the augurers ?\\nthey would not have you to stir forth today .\\nplucking the entrails of an offering forth , they could not find a heart within the beast .\\nthe gods do this in shame of cowardice .\\ncaesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear .\\nno , caesar shall not .\\nwe are two lions littered in one day , and i the elder and more terrible .\\nand caesar shall go forth .\\nalas , my lord , your wisdom is consumed in confidence .\\ndo not go forth today .\\ncall it my fear that keeps you in the house , and not your own .\\nwe\\'ll send mark antony to the senate house , and he shall say you are not well today .\\nmark antony shall say i am not well , and for thy humor i will stay at home .\\nhere\\'s decius brutus .\\nhe shall tell them so .\\ncaesar , all hail !\\ngood morrow , worthy caesar .\\ni come to fetch you to the senate house .\\nand you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today .\\nshall caesar send a lie ?\\nhave i in conquest stretched mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?\\ndecius , go tell them caesar will not come .\\nmost mighty caesar , let me know some cause , lest i be laughed at when i tell them so .\\nthe cause is in my will .\\ni will not come .\\nthat is enough to satisfy the senate .\\nbut for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i will let you know .\\ncalphurnia here , my wife , stays me at home .\\nand these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent , and on her knee hath begged that i will stay at home today .\\nthis dream is all amiss interpreted .\\nit was a vision fair and fortunate .\\nyour statue spouting blood in many pipes , in which so many smiling romans bathed , signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood , and that great men shall press for tinctures , stains , relics , and cognizance .\\nthis by calphurnia\\'s dream is signified .\\nand this way have you well expounded it .\\ni have , when you have heard what i can say .\\nand know it now : the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar .\\nif you shall send them word you will not come , their minds may change .\\nhow foolish do your fears seem now , calphurnia !\\ni am ashamed i did yield to them .\\ngive me my robe , for i will go .\\nand look , where publius is come to fetch me .\\ngood morrow , caesar .\\nwelcome , publius .\\ngood

your pains and courtesy .\\nso to most noble caesar .\\ni am to blame to be thus waited for .\\nnow , cinna. , now , metellus. , what , trebonius , i have an hour\\'s talk in store for you .\\nremember that you call on me today .\\nbe near me , that i may remember you .\\ncaesar , i will .\\ngood friends , go in and taste some wine with me .\\nand we , like friends , will straightway go together .\\ncalphurnia !\\npeace , ho !\\ncaesar speaks .\\ncalphurnia !\\nhere , my lord .\\ncaesar , my lord .\\ni shall remember .\\nwhen caesar says , \"do this , \" it is performed .\\nset on ,

.\\nprithee , listen well .\\nsooth , madam , i hear nothing .\\ncome hither , fellow .\\nwhich way hast thou been ?\\nat mine own house , good lady .\\nwhat is \\'t o\\'clock ?\\nabout the ninth hour

.\\nif it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear me , i shall beseech him to befriend himself .\\nwhy , know\\'st thou any harm\\'s intended towards him ?\\nnone that i know will be ; much that i fear may chance .\\ngood morrow to you .\\nhere the street is narrow .\\nthe throng that follows caesar at the heels , of senators , of praetors , common suitors , will crowd a feeble man almost to death .\\ni\\'ll get me to a place more void , and there speak to great caesar as he comes along .\\ni must go in .\\nay , caesar , but not gone .\\no caesar , read mine first , for mine\\'s

slenderly known himself .\\nthe best and soundest of his time hath been but rash .\\nthen must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-engrafted condition , but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them .\\nsuch unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent\\'s banishment .\\nthere is further compliment of

bloody proclamation to escape , that followed me so near , o our lives \\' sweetness ,\\nand in this habit met i my father with his bleeding rings , their precious stones new lost , became his guide , led him , begged for him , saved him from despair .\\nnever , o fault ! , revealed myself unto him until some half-hour past , when i was armed .\\nbut his flawed heart , alack , too weak the conflict to support , \\'twixt two extremes of passion , joy and grief , burst smilingly .\\nthis speech of yours hath moved me , and shall perchance do good .\\nbut speak you on .\\nyou look as you had something more to say .\\nif there be more , more woeful , hold it in .\\nfor i am almost ready to dissolve , hearing of this .\\nthis would have seemed a period to such as love not sorrow , but

evil in by a divine thrusting-on .\\nmy father compounded with my mother under the dragon\\'s tail and my nativity was under ursa major , so that it follows i am rough and lecherous .\\nfut , i should

deceitful , sudden , malicious , smacking of every sin that has a name .\\nbut there\\'s no bottom , none , in my voluptuousness .\\nyour wives , your daughters , your matrons , and your maids could not fill up the cistern of my lust , and my desire all continent impediments would o\\'erbear that did oppose my will .\\nbetter macbeth than such an one to reign .\\nboundless intemperance in nature

are open .\\nay , but their sense is shut .\\nwhat is it she does now ?\\nlook , how she rubs her hands .\\nit is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands .\\nyet here\\'s a spot .\\nhark !\\nshe speaks .\\ni will set down what comes from her , to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .\\ndo you mark that ?\\nthe thane of fife had a wife .\\nwhere is she now ? , what , will

.\\ni would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body .\\nwell , well , well .\\npray god it be , sir .\\nthis disease is beyond my practice .\\nyet i have known those which

does the tyrant ?\\ngreat dunsinane he strongly fortifies .\\nbut , for certain , he can not buckle his distempered cause within the belt of rule .\\nwho then shall blame his pestered senses to recoil and start , when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there ?\\nmake we our march towards birnam .\\nsilenced with that , in viewing o\\'er the rest o \\' the selfsame day , he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks , nothing afeard of what thyself didst make , strange images of death .\\nas thick as tale can post with post , and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdom\\'s great defense , and poured them down before him .\\nwe are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks , only to herald thee into his sight , not pay thee .\\nwhy do you dress me in borrowed robes ?\\nwhether he was combined with those of norway , or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage , or that with both he labored in his country\\'s wrack , i know not ; but treasons capital ,

?\\nthe spirits that know all mortal consequences have pronounced me thus : \"fear not , macbeth .\\nno man that\\'s born of woman shall e\\'er have power upon thee.\" then fly , false thanes , and

and make discovery err in report of us .\\nit shall be done .\\nwe learn no other but the confident tyrant keeps still in dunsinane and will endure our setting down before \\'t .\\nhang out our

forced with those that should be ours , we might have met them dareful , beard to beard , and beat them backward home .\\nwhat is that noise ?\\nit is the cry of women , my good lord .\\ni have almost forgot the taste of fears .\\nthe time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night-shriek , and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in \\'t .\\nwherefore was that cry ?\\nthe queen , my lord , is dead .\\nshe should have died hereafter .\\ntomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time , and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death .\\nout , out , brief candle !\\nit is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing .\\ngracious my lord , i should report that which i say i saw , but know not how to do \\'t .\\nwell , say , sir .\\nas i did stand my watch upon the hill , i looked toward birnam , and anon methought the wood began to move .\\nliar and slave !\\nlet me endure your wrath , if \\'t be not so .\\nwithin this three mile may you see it coming ; i say , a moving grove .\\nif thou speak\\'st false , upon the next tree shall thou hang alive till famine cling thee .\\nif thy speech be sooth , i care not if thou dost for me as much .\\nnow near enough .\\nfare you well .\\ndo we but find the tyrant\\'s power tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .\\nthey have tied me to a stake .\\ni can not fly , but , bearlike , i must fight the course .\\nwhat\\'s he that was not born of woman ?\\nsuch a one am i to fear , or none .\\nwhat is thy name ?\\nthou \\'lt be afraid to hear it .\\nno , though thou call\\'st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell .\\nmy name\\'s macbeth .\\nthe devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear .\\nno , nor more fearful .\\nthou liest , abhorred tyrant .\\nbut swords i smile at , weapons laugh to scorn , brandished by man that\\'s of a woman born .\\nbut \\'tis strange .\\nthat way the noise is .\\ntyrant , show thy face !\\neither thou , macbeth , or else my sword with an unbattered edge i sheathe again undeeded .\\nthere thou shouldst be ; by this great clatter , one of the greatest note seems bruited .\\nthis way , my lord .\\nthe castle\\'s gently rendered .\\nenter , sir , the castle .\\nturn , hellhound , turn !\\nbut get thee back .\\ni have no words .\\nmy voice is in my sword .\\nthou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out !\\nas easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed .\\nlet fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ; i bear a charmed life , which must not yield to one of woman born .\\ni\\'ll not fight with thee .\\nthen yield thee , coward , and live to be the show and gaze o \\' th \\' time .\\nwe\\'ll have thee , as our rarer monsters are , painted on a pole , and underwrit , \"here may you see the tyrant.\" i will not yield , to kiss the ground before young malcolm\\'s feet , and to be baited with the rabble\\'s curse .\\nthough birnam wood be come to dunsinane , and thou opposed , being of no woman born , yet i will try the last .\\nbefore my body i throw my warlike shield .\\nlay on , macduff , and damned be him that first cries , \"hold , enough ! \" i would the friends we miss were safe arrived .\\nsome must go off .\\nmacduff is missing , and your noble son .\\nyour son , my lord , has paid a soldier\\'s debt .\\nhe only lived but till he was a man , the which no sooner had his prowess confirmed in the unshrinking station where he fought , but like a man he died .\\nthen he is dead ?\\nay , and brought off the field .\\nyour cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth , for then it hath no end .\\nhad he his hurts before ?\\nay , on the front .\\nwhy then , god\\'s soldier be he !\\nhad i as many sons as i have hairs , i would not wish them to a fairer death .\\nand so , his knell is knolled .\\nhe\\'s worth more sorrow , and that i\\'ll spend for him .\\nhe\\'s worth no more .\\nthey say he parted well and paid his score .\\nand so , god be with him !\\nhere comes newer comfort .\\nhail , king !\\nfor so thou art .\\nbehold where stands the usurper\\'s cursed head .\\nthe time is free .\\nhail , king of scotland !\\nmy thanes and kinsmen , henceforth be earls , the first that ever scotland in such an honor

your pains are registered where every day i turn the leaf to read them .\\nlet us toward the king .\\nvery gladly .\\ntill then , enough .\\nmy liege , they are not yet come back .\\nbut i have spoke with one that saw him die , who did report that very frankly he confessed his treasons , implored your highness \\' pardon , and set forth a deep repentance .\\nnothing in his life became him like the leaving it .\\nhe died as one that had been studied in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed as \\'twere a careless trifle .\\nthere\\'s no art to find the mind\\'s construction in the

mad to say it .\\none of my fellows had the speed of him , who , almost dead for breath , had scarcely more than would make up his message .\\ngive him tending .\\nhe brings great news .\\nmy dearest

castle hath a pleasant seat .\\nthe air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses .\\nthis guest of summer , the temple-haunting martlet , does approve , by his loved mansionry , that the heaven\\'s breath smells wooingly here .\\nno jutty , frieze , buttress , nor coign of vantage , but this bird hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle .\\nwhere they most breed and haunt , i have observed , the air is delicate .\\nsee , see , our honored hostess !\\nthe love that follows us sometime is our trouble , which still we thank as love .\\nfair and noble hostess , we

of late , and i have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people , which would be worn now in their newest gloss , not cast aside so soon .\\nwas the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself ?\\nfrom this time such i account thy love .\\nart thou afeard to be the same in thine own act and valor as thou art in desire ?\\nwouldst thou have that which thou esteem\\'st the ornament of life , and live a coward in thine own esteem , letting \"i dare not\" wait upon \"i would , \" like the poor cat i \\' th \\' adage ?\\nwhat beast was \\'t , then , that made you break this enterprise to me ?\\nwhat not put upon his spongy officers , who shall bear the guilt of our great quell ?\\nbring forth men-children only , for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males .\\nwill it not be

obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy\\'s reach , i do oppose my patience to his fury , and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his .\\ngo , one , and call the jew into the court .\\nhe is ready at the door .\\nhe comes , my lord .\\nwe all expect a gentle answer , jew .\\ni have possessed your grace of what i purpose , and by our

sharp envy .\\ncan no prayers pierce thee ?\\nno , none that thou hast wit enough to make .\\nthou almost makest me waver in my faith to hold opinion with pythagoras that souls of animals infuse

bellario ?\\ni did , my lord .\\nyou are welcome .\\ntake your place .\\nare you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court ?\\ni am informed thoroughly of the cause .\\nantonio and old shylock , both stand forth .\\nis your name shylock ?\\nshylock is my name .\\nof a strange nature is the suit you follow , yet in such rule that the venetian law can not impugn you as you do proceed. , ay , so he says .\\ndo you confess the bond ?\\ni do .\\nthen must the jew be merciful .\\non what compulsion must i ?\\ntell me that .\\nthe quality of mercy is not strained .\\nit droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath .\\nit is twice blessed : it blesseth him that gives and him that takes .\\ntis mightiest in the mightiest .\\nit becomes the throned monarch better than his crown .\\nand earthly power doth then show likest god\\'s when mercy seasons justice .\\ni have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea , which if thou follow , this strict court of venice must needs give sentence \\'gainst the merchant there .\\nmy deeds upon my head .\\ni crave the law , the penalty , and forfeit of my bond .\\nis he not able to discharge the money ?\\nif that will not suffice , i will be bound to pay it ten times o\\'er , on forfeit of my hands , my head , my heart .\\nthere is no power in venice can alter a decree established .\\ntwill be recorded for a precedent , and many an error by the same example will rush into the state .\\nit can not be .\\ni pray you , let me look upon the bond .\\nshylock , there\\'s thrice thy money offered thee .\\nan oath , an oath , i have an oath in heaven .\\nshall i lay perjury upon my soul ?\\nno , not for venice .\\nand lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant\\'s heart. , be merciful .\\ntake thrice thy money .\\nbid me tear the bond .\\nwhen it is paid according to the tenor .\\nit doth appear you are a worthy judge .\\nyou know the law .\\ni charge you by the law , whereof you are a well-deserving pillar , proceed to judgment .\\nby my soul i swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me .\\ni stay here on my bond .\\nmost heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment .\\nwhy then , thus it is : you must prepare your bosom for his knife .\\no noble judge !\\no excellent young man !\\nfor the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty , which here appeareth due upon the bond .\\ntis very true .\\no wise and upright judge !\\nhow much more elder art thou than thy looks !\\nay , his breast .\\nnearest his heart\" , those are the very words .\\nit is so .\\nare there balance here to weigh the flesh ?\\ni have them ready .\\nhave by some surgeon , shylock , on your charge , to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .\\nis it so nominated in the bond ?\\nit is not so expressed , but what of that ?\\ntwere good you do so much for charity .\\ni can not find it .\\ntis not in the bond .\\nbut little .\\ni am armed and well prepared. , give me your hand , bassanio .\\nfare you well .\\ngrieve not that i am fall\\'n to this for you , for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom .\\nrepent but you that you shall lose your friend , and he repents not that he pays your debt .\\nfor if the jew do cut but deep enough , i\\'ll pay it presently with all my heart .\\nantonio , i am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself .\\nbut life itself , my wife , and all the world are not with me esteemed above thy life .\\ni would lose all , ay , sacrifice them all here to this devil , to deliver you .\\nyour wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer .\\ni have a wife , whom i protest i love .\\ni would she were in heaven , so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew .\\ntis well you offer it behind her back .\\nthese be the christian husbands .\\ni have a daughter .\\nthe court awards it , and the law doth give it .\\nmost rightful judge !\\nand you must cut this flesh from off his breast .\\nthe law allows it , and the court awards it .\\nmost learned judge , a sentence !\\ncome , prepare .\\ntarry a little .\\nthere is something else .\\nthis bond doth give thee here no jot of blood .\\nthe words expressly are \"a pound of flesh.\" take then thy bond , take thou thy pound of flesh , but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood , thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice .\\nis that the law ?\\nthyself shalt see the act .\\nfor as thou urgest justice , be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest .\\ni take this offer then : pay the bond thrice and let the christian go .\\nhere is the money .\\nsoft !\\nthe jew shall have all justice .\\nsoft , no haste .\\nhe shall have nothing but the penalty .\\ntherefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .\\nshed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh .\\nif thou takest more or less than a just pound , be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple , nay , if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair , thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate .\\na second daniel ! , a daniel , jew !\\nnow , infidel , i have you on the hip .\\nwhy doth the jew pause ?\\ntake thy forfeiture .\\ngive me my principal , and let me go .\\ni have it ready for thee .\\nhere it is .\\nyour father was ever virtuous , and holy men at their death have good inspirations .\\ni pray thee , overname them .\\nfirst , there is the neapolitan prince .\\ni am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith .\\nthen there is the county palatine .\\nhe doth nothing but frown , as who should say , \"an you will not have me , choose.\" he hears merry tales and smiles not .\\ni fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .\\ni had rather be married to a death\\'s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these .\\ngod defend me from these two !\\nhow say you by the french lord , monsieur le bon ?\\nhe hath refused it in the open court .\\nhe shall have merely justice and his bond .\\nthou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril , jew .\\nwhy then , the devil give him good of it !\\ni\\'ll stay no longer question .\\ntarry , jew .\\nthe law hath yet another hold on you .\\nit is enacted in the laws of venice , if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen , the party \\'gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods .\\nthe other half comes to the privy coffer of the state , and the offender\\'s life lies in the mercy of the duke only \\'gainst all other voice .\\ndown , therefore , and beg mercy of the duke .\\ntherefore thou must be hanged at the state\\'s charge .\\nthat thou shalt see the difference of our spirit , i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it .\\nfor half thy wealth , it is antonio\\'s .\\nthe other half comes to the general state , which humbleness may drive unto a fine .\\nay , for the state , not for antonio .\\nnay , take my life and all .\\npardon not that .\\nyou take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house .\\nyou take my life when you do take the means whereby i live .\\nwhat mercy can you render him , antonio ?\\na halter gratis , nothing else , for god\\'s sake .\\nso please my lord the duke and all the court , to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content , so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter .\\ntwo things provided more : that for this favor he presently become a christian ; the other , that he do record a gift here in the court , of all he dies possessed , unto his son lorenzo and his daughter .\\nhe shall do this , or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here .\\nart thou contented , jew ?\\nwhat dost thou say ?\\ni am content .\\ni pray you , give me leave to go from hence .\\ni am not well .\\nsend the deed after me , and i will sign it .\\nget thee gone , but do it .\\ni must away this night toward padua , and it is meet i presently set forth .\\ni am sorry that your leisure serves you not. , antonio , gratify this gentleman , for in my mind you are much bound to him .\\nand stand indebted , over and above , in love and service to you evermore .\\nhe is well paid that is well satisfied .\\nand i , delivering you , am satisfied , and therein do account myself well paid .\\nmy mind was never yet more mercenary .\\ni pray you , know me when we meet again .\\ni wish you well , and so i take my leave .\\ntake some remembrance of us as a tribute , not as a fee .\\nthis ring , good sir , alas , it is a trifle .\\ni will not shame myself to give you this .\\ni will have nothing else but only this .\\nand now methinks i have a mind to it .\\nthere\\'s more depends on this than on the value .\\nthe dearest ring in venice will i give you , and find it out by proclamation .\\nonly for this , i pray you , pardon me .\\ni see , sir , you are liberal in offers .\\nyou taught me first to beg , and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered .\\ngood sir , this ring was given me by my wife .\\nand when she put it on , she made me vow that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it .\\nthat \\'scuse serves many men to save their gifts .\\nan if your wife be not a madwoman , and know how well i have deserved the ring , she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me .\\nwell , peace be with you .\\nmy lord bassanio , let him have the ring .\\ncome , you and i will thither presently .\\nand in the morning early will we both fly toward belmont .\\ncome , antonio .\\ninquire the jew\\'s house out .\\ngive him this deed , and let him sign it .\\nwe\\'ll away tonight , and be a day before our husbands home .\\nthis deed will be well welcome to lorenzo .\\nfurthermore , i pray you show my youth old shylock\\'s house .\\nthat will i do .\\naway , make haste .\\nthou know\\'st where i will tarry .\\nthe moon shines bright .\\nin such a night as this , when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise , in such a night troilus methinks mounted the trojan walls and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night .\\nin such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well , stealing her soul with many vows of faith , and ne\\'er a true one .\\nin such a night did pretty jessica , like a little shrew , slander her love , and he forgave it her .\\nbut , hark , i hear the footing of a man .\\nwho comes so fast in silence of the night ?\\na friend .\\na friend ?\\nwhat friend ?\\nyour name , i pray you , friend ?\\nstephano is my name , and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at belmont .\\nshe doth stray about by holy crosses , where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours .\\nwho comes with her ?\\nnone but a holy hermit and her maid .\\ni pray you , is my master yet returned ?\\nsola , sola !\\nwo , ha , ho !\\nsola , sola !\\nwho calls ?\\nsola !\\ndid you see master lorenzo ?\\nleave holloaing , man .\\nhere .\\nsola !\\nwhere , where ?\\nhere .\\ntell him there\\'s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news .\\nmy master will be here ere morning .\\nsweet soul , let\\'s in , and there expect their coming .\\nand yet no matter .\\ngod made him and therefore let him pass for a man .\\nin truth , i know it is a sin to be a mocker , but he ! , why , he hath a horse better than the neapolitan\\'s , a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine .\\nwhat say you then to falconbridge , the young baron of england ?\\nyou know i say nothing to him , for he understands not me , nor i him .\\nhe hath neither latin , french , nor italian , and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english .\\nhe is a proper man\\'s picture , but alas , who can converse with a dumb show ?\\nhow oddly he is suited !\\ni think he bought his doublet in italy , his round hose in france , his bonnet in germany , and his behavior everywhere .\\nwhat think you of the scottish lord , his neighbor ?\\nhow sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !\\nhere will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears .\\nsoft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony .\\nsit , jessica .\\nlook how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold .\\ncome ho , and wake diana with a hymn !\\nwith sweetest touches pierce your mistress \\' ear , and draw her home with music .\\ni am never merry when i hear sweet music .\\nthe motions of his spirit are dull as night , and his affections dark as erebus .\\nlet no such man be trusted .\\nmark the music .\\nthat light we see is burning in my hall .\\nhow far that little candle throws his beams !\\nso shines a good deed in a naughty world .\\nwhen the moon shone we did not see the candle .\\nso doth the greater glory dim the less .\\na substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by , and then his state empties itself , as doth an inland brook into the main of waters .\\nmusic , hark .\\nit is your music , madam , of the house .\\nnothing is good , i see , without respect .\\nhow many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection !\\npeace !\\nhow the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked .\\nthat is the voice , or i am much deceived , of portia .\\nhe knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , by the bad voice .\\ndear lady , welcome home .\\nwe have been praying for our husbands \\' welfare , which speed , we hope , the better for our words .\\nare they returned ?\\ngo in , nerissa .\\ngive order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence. , nor you , lorenzo. , jessica , nor you .\\ni hear his trumpet .\\nthis night methinks is but the daylight sick .\\nit looks a little paler .\\ntis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid .\\ni thank you , madam .\\ngive welcome to my friend .\\nthis is the man , this is antonio , to whom i am so infinitely bound .\\nsir , you are very welcome to our house .\\nit must appear in other ways than words , therefore i scant this breathing courtesy .\\na quarrel , ho , already ?\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nabout a hoop of gold , a paltry ring that she did give me , whose posy was for all the world like cutler\\'s poetry upon a knife , \"love me and leave me not.\" what talk you of the posy or the value ?\\nyou swore to me when i did give it you that you would wear it till your hour of death , and that it should lie with you in your grave .\\ngave it a judge\\'s clerk !\\nhe will , an if he live to be a man .\\nay , if a woman live to be a man .\\ni could not for my heart deny it him .\\nyou were to blame , i must be plain with you , to part so slightly with your wife\\'s first gift , a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh .\\ni gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it .\\nand here he stands .\\ni dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters .\\nnow in faith , gratiano , you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief .\\nan \\'twere to me , i should be mad at it .\\nmy lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begged it and indeed deserved it too .\\nand then the boy , his clerk , that took some pains in writing , he begged mine .\\nand neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings .\\nwhat ring gave you my lord ?\\nnot that , i hope , which you received of me .\\nif i could add a lie unto a fault i would deny it .\\nbut you see my finger hath not the ring upon it .\\nit is gone .\\nsweet portia , if you did know to whom i gave the ring , if you did know for whom i gave the ring , and would conceive for what i gave the ring , and how unwillingly i left the ring when naught would be accepted but the ring , you would abate the strength of your displeasure .\\nif you had known the virtue of the ring , or half her worthiness that gave the ring , or your own honor to contain the ring , you would not then have parted with the ring .\\nnerissa teaches me what to believe .\\ni\\'ll die for \\'t but some woman had the ring .\\nwhat should i say , sweet lady ?\\ni was enforced to send it after him .\\nlet not that doctor e\\'er come near my house !\\nsince he hath got the jewel that i loved , and that which you did swear to keep for me , i will become as liberal as you .\\ni\\'ll not deny him anything i have , no , not my body , nor my husband\\'s bed .\\nknow him i shall , i am well sure of it .\\nlie not a night from home .\\nwatch me like argus .\\nif you do not , if i be left alone , now , by mine honor , which is yet mine own , i\\'ll have that doctor for my bedfellow .\\ni am th \\' unhappy subject of these quarrels .\\nsir , grieve not you .\\nportia , forgive me this enforced wrong , and in the hearing of these many friends i swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes wherein i see myself , mark you but that !\\nin both my eyes he doubly sees himself , in each eye , one .\\nswear by your double self , and there\\'s an oath of credit !\\nnay , but hear me .\\npardon this fault , and by my soul i swear i never more will break an oath with thee .\\ni once did lend my body for his wealth , which but for him that had your husband\\'s ring had quite miscarried .\\nby heaven , it is the same i gave the doctor !\\ni had it of him .\\nwhat , are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?\\nspeak not so grossly. , you are all amazed .\\ni am dumb .\\nay , but the clerk that never means to do it unless he live until he be a man .\\nsweet lady , you have given me life and living .\\nhow like you the young german , the duke of saxony\\'s nephew ?\\nvery vilely in the morning , when he is sober , and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk .\\nwhen he is best he is a little worse than a man , and when he is worst he is little better than a beast .\\ni will do any thing , nerissa , ere i\\'ll be married to a sponge .\\nyou need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords .\\nand i pray god grant them a fair departure .\\ndo you not remember , lady , in your father\\'s time a venetian , a scholar and a soldier , that came hither in company of the marquess of montferrat ?\\nhow now , lorenzo ?\\nmy clerk hath some good comforts too for you .\\nay , and i\\'ll give them him without a fee .\\nfair ladies , you drop manna in the way of starved people .\\nit is almost morning , and yet i am sure you are not satisfied of these events at full .\\nlet us go in , and charge us there upon interr\\'gatories , and we will answer all things faithfully .\\nlet it be so .\\nthe first interr\\'gatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay , or go to bed now , being two hours to day .\\nbut were the day come , i should wish it dark , that i were couching with the doctor\\'s clerk .\\ntrue , madam .\\nhe , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady .\\ni remember him well , and i remember him worthy of thy praise .\\nhow now , what news ?\\nthe four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave .\\nand there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the prince of morocco , who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .\\nif i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell , i should be glad of his approach .\\nif he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , i had rather he should shrive me than wive me .\\ncome , nerissa. ,\\nthree thousand ducats , well .\\nay , sir , for three months .\\nfor three months , well .\\nfor the which , as i told you , antonio shall be bound .\\nantonio shall become bound , well .\\nmay you stead me ?\\nwill you pleasure me ?\\nshall i know your answer ?\\nthree thousand ducats for three months , and antonio bound .\\nyour answer to that ?\\nantonio is a good man .\\nhave you heard any imputation to the contrary ?\\nyet his means are in supposition .\\nhe hath an argosy bound to tripolis , another to the indies .\\ni understand moreover , upon the rialto , he hath a third at mexico , a fourth for england , and other ventures he hath squandered abroad .\\nbut ships are but boards , sailors but men .\\nthere be land rats and water rats , water thieves and land thieves , i mean pirates , and then there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks .\\nthe man is notwithstanding sufficient .\\nbe assured you may .\\nthis is signor antonio .\\nin sooth , i know not why i am so sad .\\nit wearies me ; you say it wearies you .\\nbelieve me , sir , had i such venture forth , the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad .\\nand every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad .\\nshylock , do you hear ?\\ni am debating of my present store , and by the near guess of my memory i can not instantly raise up the gross of full three thousand ducats .\\nwhat of that ?\\ntubal , a wealthy hebrew of my tribe , will furnish me .\\nbut soft !\\nhow many months do you desire ?\\nshylock , albeit i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess , yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend , i\\'ll break a custom .\\nay , ay , three thousand ducats .\\nand for three months .\\ni had forgot , three months .\\nyou told me so .\\ni do never use it .\\nwhen jacob grazed

come to me and you say , \"shylock , we would have moneys.\" you say so ! , you , that did void your rheum upon my beard and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold !\\nmoneys is your suit .\\nwhat should i say to you ?\\nshould i not say , \"hath a dog money ?\\nis it possible a cur can lend three thousand ducats ? \" or shall i bend low and in a bondman\\'s key with bated breath and whispering humbleness say this :\\nif thou wilt lend this money , lend it not as to thy friends , for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend ?\\nbut lend it rather to thine enemy , who , if he break , thou mayst with better face exact the penalty .\\nwhy , look you how you storm !\\ni would be friends with you and have your love , forget the shames that you have stained me with , supply your present wants and take no doit of usance for my moneys , and you\\'ll not hear me !\\nthis is kind i offer .\\nthis were kindness .\\nthis kindness will i show .\\ngo with me to a notary , seal me there your single bond , and , in a merry sport , if you repay me not on such a day , in such a place , such sum or sums as are expressed in the condition , let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh , to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me .\\ncontent , in faith .\\ni\\'ll seal to such a bond , and say there is much

and tender me , forsooth , affection , but by your setting on , by your consent ?\\nwhat though i be not so in grace as you , so hung upon with love , so fortunate , but miserable most , to love unloved ?\\nthis you should pity rather than despise .\\ni understand not what you mean by this .\\nay , do .\\npersever , counterfeit sad looks , make mouths upon me when i turn my back , wink each

find the forester .\\nwe will , fair queen , up to the mountain\\'s top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction .\\ni was with hercules and cadmus once , when in a wood of

seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream .\\nand he did bid us follow to the temple .\\nwhy then , we are awake .\\nit shall be called \"bottom\\'s dream\" because it hath no bottom .\\nand i will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke .\\nperadventure , to make it the more gracious , i shall sing it at her death .\\nhave you sent to bottom\\'s house ?\\nis he come home yet ?\\nhe can not be heard of .\\nout of doubt he is transported .\\nif he come not , then the play is marred .\\nit goes not forward .\\ndoth it ?\\nit is not possible .\\nno , he hath simply the best wit of

!\\nthus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life .\\nhe could not have \\'scaped sixpence a day .\\nan the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus , i\\'ll be hanged .\\nhe would

.\\naway , go away !\\ntis strange , my theseus , that these lovers speak of .\\ni never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys .\\nthe lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact .\\nbut all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigured so together , more witnesseth than fancy\\'s images and grows to something of great constancy , but , howsoever , strange and admirable .\\nhere come the lovers , full of joy and mirth. , joy , gentle friends !\\ncome now , what masques , what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our after-supper and bedtime ?\\nwhere is our usual manager of mirth ?\\nwhat revels are in hand ?\\ncall philostrate .\\nhere , mighty theseus .\\nwhat masque , what music ?\\nhow

again unsay .\\ndemetrius loves your fair .\\no happy fair !\\nyour eyes are lodestars , and your tongue\\'s sweet air more tunable than lark to shepherd\\'s ear when wheat is green , when hawthorn buds appear .\\nwere the world mine , demetrius being bated , the rest i\\'d give to be to you translated .\\nthe thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning , late deceased in beggary.\" that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony .\\ntedious\" and \"brief\" ?\\nthat is hot ice and wondrous strange snow .\\nhow shall we find the concord of this discord ?\\na play there is , my lord , some ten words long , which is as brief as i have known a play .\\nfor in all the play there is not one word apt , one player fitted .\\nfor pyramus therein doth kill himself .\\nwhich , when i saw rehearsed , i must confess , made mine eyes water , but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed .\\nwhat are they that do play it ?\\nand we will hear it .\\nno , my noble lord .\\nit is not for you .\\ni have heard it over , and it is nothing , nothing in the world , unless you can find sport in their intents , extremely stretched and conned with cru \\'l pain to do you service .\\ni will hear that play .\\ngo , bring them in. , and take your places , ladies .\\nwhy , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing .\\nhe says they can do nothing in this kind .\\nwhere i have come , great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes , where i have seen them shiver and look pale , make periods in the midst of sentences , throttle their practiced accent in their fears , and in conclusion dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome .\\nlove , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most , to my capacity .\\nso please your grace , the prologue is addressed .\\nlet him approach .\\nif we offend , it is with our good will .\\nthat you should think we come not to offend , but with good will .\\nconsider then we come but in despite .\\nwe do not come as minding to contest you , our true intent is .\\nall for your delight we are not here .\\nthat you should here repent you , the actors are at hand , and by their show you shall know all that you are like to know .\\nthis fellow doth not stand upon points .\\nhe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt .\\nhe knows not the stop .\\na good moral , my lord : it is not enough to speak , but to speak true .\\nhis speech was like a tangled chain .\\nwho is next ?\\ni wonder if the lion be to speak .\\nno wonder , my lord .\\nwould you desire lime and hair to speak better ?\\nit is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse , my lord .\\npyramus draws near the wall .\\nsilence !\\ni fear my thisbe\\'s promise is forgot ! , and thou , o wall , o sweet , o lovely wall , that stand\\'st between her father\\'s ground and mine .\\njove shield thee well for this !\\nbut what see i ?\\nno thisbe do i see .\\no wicked wall through whom i see no bliss !\\ncursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me !\\nthe wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again .\\ni see a voice .\\nnow will i to the chink , to spy an i can

but shadows , and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them .\\nit must be your imagination then , and not theirs .\\nhere come two noble beasts in , a man and a lion .\\na very gentle beast , of a good conscience .\\nthis lion is a very fox , for his valor .\\ntrue .\\nand a goose for his discretion .\\nnot so , my lord .\\nfor his valor can not carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose .\\nhis discretion , i am sure , can not carry his valor , for the goose carries not the fox .\\nit is well .\\nleave it to his discretion , and let us listen to the moon .\\nthis lanthorn doth the horned moon present .\\nmyself the man i \\' th \\' moon do seem to be , this is the greatest error of all the rest .\\nthe man should be put into the lanthorn .\\nhow is it else the \"man i \\' th \\' moon\" ?\\nhe dares not come there for the candle .\\nfor you see , it is already in snuff .\\ni am aweary of this moon .\\nproceed , moon .\\nall that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon ; i , the man in the moon ; this thornbush , my thornbush ; and this dog , my dog .\\nwhy , all these should be in the lanthorn , for all these are in the moon. , but silence !\\nhere comes thisbe .\\nthis is old ninny\\'s tomb .\\nwhere is my love ?\\nwell roared , lion !\\nwell run , thisbe !\\nwell shone , moon ! , truly , the moon shines with a good grace .\\nwell moused , lion !\\no , teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius \\' heart .\\ni frown upon him , yet he loves me still .\\noh , that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !\\ni give him curses , yet he gives me love .\\noh , that my prayers could such affection move !\\nthe more i hate , the more he follows me .\\nthe more i love , the more he hateth me .\\nhis folly , helena , is no fault of mine .\\nnone , but your beauty .\\nwould that fault were mine !\\ntake comfort .\\nhe no more shall see my face .\\nlysander and myself will fly this place .\\nbefore the time i did lysander see seemed athens as a paradise to me .\\noh , then , what graces in my love do dwell , that he hath turned a heaven unto a hell !\\nhelen , to you our minds we will unfold .\\ntomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass , decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass ( a time that lovers \\' flights doth still conceal ) , through athens \\' gates have we devised to steal .\\nand then came pyramus .\\nand so the lion vanished .\\nsweet moon , i thank thee for thy sunny beams .\\nbut mark , poor knight , what dreadful dole is here !\\neyes , do you see ?\\nhow can it be ?\\no dainty duck !\\no dear !\\no fates , come , come , cut thread and thrum .\\nquail , crush , conclude , and quell !\\no wherefore , nature , didst thou lions frame ?\\nthus die i , thus , thus , thus .\\nnow am i dead .\\nnow die , die , die , die , die .\\nwith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .\\nmethinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus .\\ni hope she will be brief .\\nshe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes .\\nand thus she means , videlicet , asleep , my love ?\\nwhat , dead , my dove ?\\no pyramus , arise !\\nspeak , speak .\\nquite dumb ?\\ndead , dead ?\\na tomb must cover thy sweet eyes .\\nthese lily lips , this cherry nose , these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone , are gone .\\nlovers , make moan .\\nhis eyes were green as leeks .\\no sisters three , come , come to me with hands as pale as milk .\\nlay them in gore , since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .\\ntongue , not a word .\\ncome , trusty sword .\\ncome , blade , my breast imbrue .\\nmoonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .\\nay , and wall too .\\nno epilogue , i pray you , for your play needs no excuse .\\nnever excuse , for when the players are all dead , there needs none to be blamed .\\nmarry , if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbe\\'s garter , it would have been a fine tragedy .\\nand so it is , truly , and very notably discharged .\\nbut come , your bergomask .\\nlet your epilogue alone .\\nthe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve .\\nlovers , to bed .\\ntis almost fairy time .\\nsweet friends , to bed .\\nthrough the house give glimmering light , by the dead and drowsy fire .\\nfirst , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note .\\nhand in hand with fairy grace will we sing and bless this place .\\nif you pardon , we will mend .\\nand , as i am an honest puck , if we have unearned luck now to \\'scape the serpent\\'s tongue , we will make amends ere long .\\nelse the puck a liar call .\\nso good night unto you all .\\ngive me your hands if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends .\\nthere my lysander and myself shall meet .\\nand thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies .\\nfarewell , sweet playfellow .\\nwe must starve our sight from lovers \\' food till morrow deep midnight .\\ni will , my hermia .\\nhelena , adieu .\\nas you on him , demetrius dote on you !\\nbut what of that ?\\ndemetrius thinks not so .\\nhe will not know what all but he do know .\\nthings base and vile , holding no quantity , love can transpose to form and dignity .\\nlove looks not with the eyes but with the mind .\\nand therefore is winged cupid painted blind .\\nnor hath love\\'s mind of any judgment taste , wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste .\\nand therefore is love said to be a child , because in choice he is so oft beguiled .\\nthen to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her .\\nis all our company here ?\\nfirst , good peter quince , say what the play treats on , then read the names of the actors , and so grow to a point .\\nanswer as i call you. , nick bottom , the weaver ?\\nready .\\nname what part i am for and proceed .\\nyou , nick bottom , are set down for pyramus .\\nwhat is pyramus ?\\ni will condole in some measure. , to the rest. , yet my chief humor is for a tyrant .\\ni could play ercles rarely , or a part to tear a cat in to make all split .\\na lover is more condoling .\\nfrancis flute , the bellows-mender ?\\nhere , peter quince .\\nwhat is thisbe ?\\na wandering knight ?\\nit is the lady that pyramus must love .\\nnay , faith , let me not play a woman .\\ni have a beard coming .\\nthat\\'s all one .\\nyou shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will .\\nan i may hide my face , let me play thisbe too !\\nyou must play pyramus. , and flute , you thisbe .\\nrobin starveling , the tailor ?\\nhere , peter quince .\\nrobin starveling , you must play thisbe\\'s mother. , tom snout , the tinker ?\\nhere , peter quince .\\nyou , pyramus \\' father. , myself , thisbe\\'s father. , snug the joiner , you , the lion\\'s part. , and i hope here is a play fitted .\\nhave you the lion\\'s part written ?\\npray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study .\\nlet me play the lion too .\\nand that were enough to hang us all .\\nthat would hang us , every mother\\'s son .\\ni grant you , friends , if you should fright the ladies out of their wits , they would have no more discretion but to hang us .\\nfor pyramus is a sweet-faced man , a proper man as one shall see in a summer\\'s day , a most lovely , gentlemanlike man .\\ntherefore you must needs play pyramus .\\nwell , i will undertake it .\\nwhat beard were i best to play it in ?\\nwhy , what you will .\\nfour days will quickly steep themselves in night .\\nfour nights will quickly dream away the time .\\nand then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities .\\nturn melancholy forth to funerals .\\nthe pale companion is not for our pomp .\\nbut i will wed thee in another key , with pomp , with triumph , and with reveling .\\nhappy be theseus , our renowned duke .\\ni will discharge it in either your straw-color beard , your orange-tawny beard , your purple-in-grain beard , or your french crown-color beard , your perfect yellow .\\nthere will we rehearse , for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company , and our devices known .\\nin the meantime i will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants .\\ni pray you , fail me not .\\nwe will meet , and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously .\\nadieu .\\nat the duke\\'s oak we meet .\\nenough .\\nhold , or cut bowstrings .\\nhow now , spirit ?\\nwhither wander you ?\\nover hill , over dale , thorough bush , thorough brier , over park , over pale , thorough flood , thorough fire .\\ni do wander everywhere swifter than the moon\\'s sphere .\\nand i serve the fairy queen to dew her orbs upon the green .\\nthe cowslips tall her pensioners be .\\nin those freckles live their savors .\\ni must go seek some dewdrops here and hang a pearl in every cowslip\\'s ear .\\nfarewell , thou lob of spirits .\\ni\\'ll be gone .\\nour queen and all our elves come here anon .\\nfor oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she , as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king .\\nand jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild .\\nbut she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy .\\nthose that \"hobgoblin\" call you , and \"sweet puck , \" you do their work , and they shall have good luck .\\nare not you he ?\\nthou speak\\'st aright .\\ni am that merry wanderer of the night .\\nand sometime lurk i in a gossip\\'s bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab , and when she drinks , against her lips i bob and on her withered dewlap pour the ale .\\nthen slip i from her bum , down topples she , and \"tailor ! \" cries , and falls into a cough , and then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh , and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there .\\nbut , room , fairy !\\nhere comes oberon .\\nand here my mistress .\\nwould that he were gone !\\nwhat , jealous oberon ? , fairies , skip hence .\\ni have forsworn his bed and company .\\ntarry , rash wanton .\\nwhy art thou here , come from the farthest step of india ?\\nbut that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , your buskined mistress and your warrior love , to theseus must be wedded , and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity .\\nhow canst thou thus for shame , titania , knowing i know thy love to theseus ?\\nglance at my credit with hippolyta , didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigouna , whom he ravished ?\\nand make him with fair aegles break his faith , with ariadne and antiopa ?\\nthese are the forgeries of jealousy .\\nand never , since the middle summer\\'s spring , met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , by paved fountain , or by rushy brook , or in the beached margent of the sea , to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , but with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport .\\ntherefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs , which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents .\\nthe ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain , the ploughman lost his sweat , and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard .\\nthe fold stands empty in the drowned field , and crows are fatted with the murrain flock .\\ntherefore the moon , the governess of floods , pale in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound .\\nthe spring , the summer , the childing autumn , angry winter change their wonted liveries , and the mazed world , by their increase , now knows not which is which .\\nand this same progeny of evils comes from our debate , from our dissension .\\nwe are their parents and original .\\ndo you amend it then .\\nit lies in you .\\nwhy should titania cross her oberon ?\\ni do but beg a little changeling boy , to be my henchman .\\nset your heart at rest .\\nthe fairyland buys not the child of me .\\nhow long within this wood intend you stay ?\\nperchance till after theseus \\' wedding day .\\nif you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels , go with us .\\nif not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts .\\ngive me that boy and i will go with thee .\\nnot for thy fairy kingdom. , fairies , away !\\nwe shall chide downright , if i longer stay .\\nwell , go thy way .\\nthou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury. , my gentle puck , come hither .\\ni remember .\\nthat very time i saw ( but thou couldst not ) flying between the cold moon and the earth , cupid all armed .\\na certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west , and loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts .\\nbut i might see young cupid\\'s fiery shaft quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon , and the imperial votaress passed on , in maiden meditation , fancy-free .\\nyet marked i where the bolt of cupid fell .\\nit fell upon a little western flower , before milk-white , now purple with love\\'s wound .\\nand maidens call it \"love-in-idleness.\" fetch me that flower .\\nthe herb i showed thee once .\\nthe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees .\\nfetch me this herb , and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league .\\ni\\'ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes .\\nhaving once this juice , i\\'ll watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes .\\nthe next thing then she waking looks upon , be it on lion , bear , or wolf , or bull , on meddling monkey or on busy ape , she shall pursue it with the soul of love .\\nand ere i take this charm from of her sight , as i can take it with another herb , i\\'ll make her render up her page to me .\\nbut who comes here ?\\ni love thee not , therefore pursue me not .\\nwhere is lysander and fair hermia ?\\nthe one i\\'ll stay , the other stayeth me .\\nthou told\\'st me they were stol\\'n unto this wood .\\nand here am i , and wood within this wood , because i can not meet my hermia .\\nhence , get thee gone , and follow me no more .\\nyou draw me , you hard-hearted adamant .\\nbut yet you draw not iron , for my heart is true as steel .\\nleave you your power to draw , and i shall have no power to follow you .\\ndo i entice you ?\\ndo i speak you fair ?\\nor rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i can not , love you ?\\nand even for that do i love you the more .\\ni am your spaniel .\\nand , demetrius , the more you beat me , i will fawn on you .\\nuse me but as your spaniel , spurn me , strike me , neglect me , lose me .\\nonly give me leave , unworthy as i am , to follow you .\\nfor i am sick when i do look on thee .\\nand i am sick when i look not on you .\\nyour virtue is my privilege .\\nnor doth this wood lack worlds of company , for you in my respect are all the world .\\nthen how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me ?\\ni\\'ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts .\\nthe wildest hath not such a heart as you .\\nlet me go .\\nor if thou follow me , do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood .\\nay , in the temple , in the town , the field you do me mischief .\\nfie , demetrius !\\nyour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex .\\nwe can not fight for love as men may do .\\ni\\'ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell , to die upon the hand i love so well .\\nfare thee well , nymph .\\nere he do leave this grove , thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love .\\nhast thou the flower there ?\\nwelcome , wanderer .\\nay , there it is .\\ni pray thee , give it me .\\nthanks , good egeus .\\nwhat\\'s the news with thee ?\\nfull of vexation come i with complaint against my child , my daughter hermia. , stand forth , demetrius. , my noble lord , this man hath my consent to marry her. , stand forth , lysander. , and my gracious duke , this man hath bewitched the bosom of my child. , thou , thou , lysander , thou hast given her rhymes , and interchanged love tokens with my child .\\nthou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love , and stol\\'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gauds , conceits , knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , messengers of strong prevailment in unhardened youth .\\nwith cunning hast thou filched my daughter\\'s heart , turned her obedience ( which is due to me ) to stubborn harshness. , and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius , i beg the ancient privilege of athens .\\nas she is mine , i may dispose of her , which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death , according to our law immediately provided in that case .\\nwhat say you , hermia ?\\ndemetrius is a worthy gentleman .\\nthere sleeps titania sometime of the night , lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .\\nand there the snake throws her enameled skin , weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in .\\nand with the juice of this i\\'ll streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies .\\nfear not , my lord .\\nyour servant shall do so .\\nhence , away !\\nnow all is well .\\none aloof stand sentinel .\\nwhat thou seest when thou dost wake , do it for thy true love take .\\nwake when some vile thing is near .\\nbe it so , lysander .\\nfind you out a bed , for i upon this bank will rest my head .\\none heart , one bed , two bosoms , and one troth .\\nnay , good lysander .\\ndo not lie so near .\\ni mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it .\\nthen by your side no bed room me deny .\\nand , good night , sweet friend .\\nthy love ne\\'er alter till thy sweet life end !\\namen , amen to that fair prayer , say i .\\nhere is my bed .\\npretty soul !\\nstay , though thou kill me , sweet demetrius .\\ni charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus .\\no , wilt thou darkling leave me ?\\ndo not so .\\nstay , on thy peril .\\ni alone will go .\\noh , i am out of breath in this fond chase .\\nthe more my prayer , the lesser is my grace .\\nhappy is hermia , wheresoe\\'er she lies , for she hath blessed and attractive eyes .\\nhow came her eyes so bright ?\\nnot with salt tears .\\nif so , my eyes are oftener washed than hers .\\nno , no , i am as ugly as a bear , for beasts that meet me run away for fear .\\ntherefore no marvel though demetrius do , as a monster , fly my presence thus .\\nwhat wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia\\'s sphery eyne ?\\ndo not say so , lysander .\\nsay not so .\\nwhat though he love your hermia ?\\nlord , what though ?\\ncontent with hermia ?\\nno .\\ni do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent .\\nnot hermia but helena i love .\\nthings growing are not ripe until their season .\\nso i , being young , till now ripe not to reason .\\nis \\'t not enough , is \\'t not enough , young man , that i did never , no , nor never can , deserve a sweet look from demetrius \\' eye , but you must flout my insufficiency ?\\ngood troth , you do me wrong , good sooth , you do , in such disdainful manner me to woo .\\nbut fare you well .\\nperforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness .\\noh , that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused !\\nare we all met ?\\npat , pat .\\nand here\\'s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .\\nthis green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house , and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .\\npeter quince , what sayest thou , bully bottom ?\\nthere are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never please .\\nfirst , pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself , which the ladies can not abide .\\nhow answer you that ?\\ni believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done .\\nnot a whit .\\ni have a device to make all well .\\nwrite me a prologue , and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords , and that pyramus is not killed indeed .\\nand for the more better assurance , tell them that i , pyramus , am not pyramus , but bottom the weaver .\\nthis will put them out of fear .\\nwell .\\nwe will have such a prologue , and it shall be written in eight and six .\\nno , make it two more .\\nlet it be written in eight and eight .\\nwill not the ladies be afeard of the lion ?\\ni fear it , i promise you .\\nfor there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living .\\ntherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion .\\nnay , you must name his name , and half his face must be seen through the lion\\'s neck .\\nfor , you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .\\nso is lysander .\\nin himself he is .\\nbut in this kind , wanting your father\\'s voice , the other must be held the worthier .\\ni would my father looked but with my eyes .\\nrather your eyes must with his judgment look .\\ni do entreat your grace to pardon me .\\ni know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts , but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case , if i refuse to wed demetrius .\\ntherefore , fair hermia , question your desires .\\nknow of your youth .\\ndoth the moon shine that night we play our play ?\\na calendar , a calendar !\\nlook in the almanac .\\nfind out moonshine , find out moonshine !\\nwhat say you , bottom ?\\nand let him hold his fingers thus , and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper .\\nif that may be then all is well .\\ncome , sit down , every mother\\'s son , and rehearse your parts. , pyramus , you begin .\\nwhen you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake. , and so everyone according to his cue .\\nspeak , pyramus. , thisbe , stand forth .\\nay , marry , must you .\\nfor you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again .\\nninus \\' tomb , \" man .\\nwhy , you must not speak that yet .\\nyou speak all your part at once , cues and all. , pyramus , enter .\\nit is \"never tire.\" oh .\\noh , monstrous !\\noh , strange !\\nwe are haunted .\\nfly , masters !\\ni\\'ll follow you .\\nsometime a horse i\\'ll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire .\\nand neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn .\\nwhy do they run away ?\\no bottom , thou art changed !\\nwhat do i see on thee ?\\nwhat do you see ?\\nyou see an ass head of your own , do you ?\\nbless thee , bottom , bless thee .\\nthou art translated .\\nbut i will not stir from this place , do what they can .\\ni will walk up and down here and i will sing , that they shall hear i am not afraid .\\nfor indeed , who would set his wit to so foolish a bird ?\\nmethinks , mistress , you should have little reason for that .\\nand yet , to say the truth , reason and love keep little company together nowadays .\\nthe more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends .\\nthou art as wise as thou art beautiful .\\nnot so , neither .\\nbut if i had wit enough to get out of this wood , i have enough to serve mine own turn .\\ni am a spirit of no common rate .\\ntherefore go with me .\\nand i will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go. , peaseblossom , cobweb , moth , and mustardseed !\\nready .\\nand i .\\nand i .\\nand i .\\nwhere shall we go ?\\nbe kind and courteous to this gentleman .\\nhop in his walks and gambol in his eyes .\\nfeed him with apricoks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .\\nand pluck the wings from painted butterflies to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .\\nnod to him , elves , and do him courtesies .\\nhail , mortal .\\nhail .\\nhail .\\nhail

.\\nhere comes my messenger. , how now , mad spirit ?\\nwhat night-rule now about this haunted grove ?\\nmy mistress with a monster is in love .\\ni led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there .\\nwhen in that moment so it came to pass , titania waked and straightway loved an ass .\\nthis falls out better than i could devise .\\nbut hast thou yet latched the athenian\\'s eyes with the love juice , as i did bid thee do ?\\ni took him sleeping , that is finished too , and the athenian woman by his side , that , when he waked , of force she must be eyed .\\noh , why rebuke you him that loves you so ?\\nlay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .\\nif thou hast slain lysander in his sleep , being o\\'er shoes in blood , plunge in the deep , and kill me

, that would not let him bide , fair helena , who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light .\\nwhy seek\\'st thou me ?\\ncould not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so ?\\nyou speak not as you think .\\nit can not be .\\nlo , she is one of this confederacy !\\nnow i perceive they have conjoined all three to fashion this false sport , in spite of me. , injurious hermia !\\nis all the counsel that we two have shared , the sisters \\' vows , the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us , oh , is it all forgot ?\\nall schooldays \\' friendship , childhood innocence ?\\nwe , hermia , like two artificial gods , have with our needles created both one flower , both on one sampler , sitting on one cushion , both warbling of one song , both in one key , as if our hands , our sides , voices , and minds , had been incorporate .\\nso we grew together , like to a double cherry , seeming parted but yet an union in partition , two lovely berries molded on one stem ;\\ndisdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes , misprizing what they look on , and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak .\\nshe can not love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self-endeared .\\nsure , i think so , and therefore certainly it were not good she knew his love , lest she make sport at it .\\nwhy , you speak truth .\\nso turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth .\\nbut who dare tell her so ?\\nif i should speak , she would mock me into air .\\no , she would laugh me out of myself , press me to death with wit .\\ntherefore let benedick , like covered fire , consume away in sighs , waste inwardly .\\nit were a better death than die with mocks , which is as bad as die with tickling .\\nno , rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion ; and truly i\\'ll devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with .\\none doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking .\\no , do not do your cousin such a wrong !\\nshe can not be so much without true judgment , having so swift and excellent a wit as she is prized to have , as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedick .\\nhe is the only man of italy , always excepted my dear claudio .\\nindeed , he hath an excellent good name .\\nhis excellence did earn it , ere he had it .\\nwhen are you married , madam ?\\nwhy , every day , tomorrow .\\ncome , go in .\\ni do but stay till your marriage be consummate , and then go i toward aragon .\\ni\\'ll bring you thither , my lord , if you\\'ll vouchsafe me .\\nnay , that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it .\\ni will only be bold with benedick for his company , for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth .\\nhe hath twice or thrice cut cupid\\'s bow-string , and the little hangman dare not shoot at him .\\nhe hath a heart as sound as a bell , and his tongue is the clapper , for what his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .\\ngallants , i am not as i have been .\\nso say i. methinks you are sadder .\\ni hope he be in love .\\nthere\\'s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love .\\nif he be sad , he wants money .\\nwhat , sigh for the toothache ?\\nyet say i , he is in love .\\nunless he have a fancy to this foolery , as it appears he hath , he is no fool for fancy , as you would have it appear he is .\\nif he be not in love with some woman , there is no believing old signs .\\nhe brushes his hat o \\' mornings .\\nwhat should that bode ?\\nhath any man seen him at the barber\\'s ?\\nno , but the barber\\'s man hath been seen with him , and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls .\\nnay , he rubs himself with civet .\\ncan you smell him out by that ?\\nyou embrace your charge too willingly .\\nher mother hath many times told me so .\\nyou have it full , benedick .\\ntruly , the lady fathers herself. , be happy , lady , for you are like an honorable father .\\nif signor leonato be her father , she would not have his head on her shoulders for all messina , as like him as she is .\\ni wonder that you will still be talking , signor benedick .\\nnobody marks you .\\nwhat , my dear lady disdain !\\nare you yet living ?\\nthat\\'s as much as to say , the sweet youth\\'s in love .\\nthe greatest note of it is his melancholy .\\nand when was he wont to wash his face ?\\nyea , or to paint himself ?\\nfor the which i hear what they say of him .\\nnay , but his jesting spirit , which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops , indeed , that tells a heavy tale for him .\\nconclude , conclude , he is in love .\\nnay , but i know who loves him .\\nshe shall be buried with her face upwards .\\nyet is this no charm for the toothache. , old signior , walk aside with me .\\ntis even so .\\nmy lord and brother , god save you .\\ngood e\\'en , brother .\\nif your leisure served , i would speak with you .\\nin private ?\\nif it please you .\\nyet count claudio may hear , for what i would speak of concerns him .\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nyou know he does .\\ni know not that , when he knows what i know .\\nif there be any impediment , i pray you discover it .\\nyou may think i love you not .\\nlet that appear hereafter , and aim better at me by that i now will manifest .\\nfor my brother , i think he holds you well , and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage , surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed .\\nwhy , what\\'s the matter ?\\ni came hither to tell you ; and , circumstances shortened , for she has been too long a-talking of , the lady is disloyal .\\nwho , hero ?\\neven she : leonato\\'s hero , your hero , every man\\'s hero .\\ndisloyal ?\\nthe word is too good to paint out her wickedness .\\ni could say she were worse .\\nthink you of a worse title , and i will fit her to it .\\nwonder not till further warrant .\\ngo but with me tonight , you shall see her chamber window entered , even the night before her wedding day .\\nif you love her then , tomorrow wed her .\\nbut it would better fit your honor to change your mind .\\ni will not think it .\\nif i see anything tonight why i should not marry her , tomorrow in the congregation , where i should wed , there will i shame her .\\nand as i wooed for thee to obtain her , i will join with thee to disgrace her .\\nbear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .\\no day untowardly turned !\\no mischief strangely thwarting !\\no plague right well prevented !\\nso will you say when you have seen the sequel .\\nare you good men and true ?\\ncome hither , neighbor seacole .\\ngod hath blessed you with a good name .\\nto be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune , but to write and read comes by nature .\\nboth which , master constable , you have .\\ni knew it would be your answer .\\nwell , for your favor , sir , why , give god thanks , and make no boast of it , and for your writing and reading , let that appear when there is no need of such vanity .\\nyou are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch ; therefore bear you the lantern .\\nhow if he will not stand ?\\nwhy , then , take no note of him , but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank god you are rid of a knave .\\nif he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the prince\\'s subjects .\\nwe know what belongs to a watch .\\nwhy , you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman , for i can not see how sleeping should offend .\\nwell , you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed .\\nhow if they will not ?\\nwhy , then , let them alone till they are sober .\\nif they make you not then the better answer , you may say they are not the men you took them for .\\nwell , sir .\\nif we know him to be a thief , shall we not lay hands on him ?\\nyou , constable , are to present the prince\\'s own person .\\nif you meet the prince in the night , you may stay him .\\nnay , by \\'r lady , that i think he can not .\\nfive shillings to one on \\'t , with any man that knows the statutes , he may stay him , marry , not without the prince be willing , for indeed the watch ought to offend no man , and it is an offense to stay a man against his will .\\nby \\'r lady , i think it be so .\\nan there be any matter of weight chances , call up me .\\nwell , masters , we hear our charge .\\nlet us go sit here upon the church bench till two , and then all to bed .\\none word more , honest neighbors .\\ni pray you watch about signior leonato\\'s door , for the wedding being there tomorrow , there is a great coil tonight .\\nadieu , be vigitant , i beseech you .\\nwhat conrade !\\nconrade , i say !\\nmass , and my elbow itched , i thought there would a scab follow .\\ni will owe thee an answer for that .\\nand now forward with thy tale .\\nstand thee close , then , under this penthouse , for it drizzles rain , and i will , like a true drunkard , utter all to thee .\\ntherefore know i have earned of don john a thousand ducats .\\nis it possible that any villainy should be so dear ?\\nthou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich .\\nfor when rich villains have need of poor ones , poor ones may make what price they will .\\ni wonder at it .\\nthat shows thou art unconfirmed .\\nthou knowest that the fashion of a doublet , or a hat , or a cloak , is nothing to a man .\\nyes , it is apparel .\\nyes , the fashion is the fashion .\\ntush , i may as well say the fool\\'s the fool .\\ndidst thou not hear somebody ?\\nno , \\'twas the vane on the house .\\nbut art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too , that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion ?\\nnot so , neither .\\nbut know that i have tonight wooed margaret , the lady hero\\'s gentlewoman , by the name of hero .\\ni should first tell thee how the prince , claudio and my master , planted and placed and possessed by my master don john , saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter .\\nthen is courtesy a turncoat .\\nbut it is certain i am loved of all ladies , only you excepted .\\nand i would i could find in my heart that i had not a hard heart , for truly i love none .\\na dear happiness to women .\\nthey would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor .\\ni had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me .\\ngod keep your ladyship still in that mind , so some gentle- man or other shall \\'scape a predestinate scratched face .\\nscratching could not make it worse an \\'twere such a face as yours were .\\nwell , you are a rare parrot-teacher .\\na bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours .\\ni would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer .\\ni have done .\\nyou always end with a jade\\'s trick .\\ni know you of old .\\nthat is the sum of all , leonato. , signior claudio and signior benedick , my dear friend leonato hath invited you all .\\ni tell him we shall stay here at the least a month , and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer .\\ni dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .\\nand thought they margaret was hero ?\\nwe charge you , in the prince\\'s name , stand !\\ncall up the right master constable .\\nwe have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .\\nand one deformed is one of them .\\ni know him ; he wears a lock .\\nmasters , masters , warrant you .\\nmasters , never speak , we charge you , let us obey you go with us .\\na commodity in question , i warrant you. , come , we\\'ll obey you .\\ngood ursula , wake my cousin beatrice and desire her to rise .\\ni will , lady .\\nand bid her come hither .\\nwell .\\ntroth , i think your other rebato were better .\\nno , pray thee , good meg , i\\'ll wear this .\\nby my troth , \\'s not so good , and i warrant your cousin will say so .\\nmy cousin\\'s a fool , and thou art another .\\ni\\'ll wear none but this .\\ni like the new tire within excellently , if the hair were a thought browner ; and your gown\\'s a most rare fashion , i \\' faith .\\ni saw the duchess of milan\\'s gown that they praise so .\\noh , that exceeds , they say .\\nbut for a fine , quaint , graceful , and excellent fashion , yours is worth ten on \\'t .\\ngod give me joy to wear it , for my heart is exceeding heavy .\\ntwill be heavier soon by the weight of a man .\\nof what , lady ?\\nis not marriage honorable in a beggar ?\\nis not your lord honorable without marriage ?\\ngood morrow , sweet hero .\\nwhy , how now ?\\ndo you speak in the sick tune ?\\ni am out of all other tune , methinks .\\ndo you sing it , and i\\'ll dance it .\\no illegitimate construction !\\nthese gloves the count sent me , they are an excellent perfume .\\ni am stuffed , cousin .\\neven since you left it .\\ndoth not my wit become me rarely ?\\nit is not seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap .\\nby my troth , i am sick .\\ni meant plain holy thistle .\\nyou may think perchance that i think you are in love .\\nnay , by \\'r lady , i am not such a fool to think what i list , nor i list not to think what i can , nor indeed i can not think , if i would think my heart out of thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love .\\nyet benedick was such another , and now is he become a man .\\nhe swore he would never marry , and yet now , in despite of his heart , he eats his meat without grudging .\\nand how you may be converted i know not , but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do .\\nnot a false gallop .\\nmadam , withdraw : the prince , the count , signor benedick , don john , and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church .\\nhelp to dress me , good coz , good meg , good ursula .\\nwhat would you with me , honest neighbor ?\\nmarry , this it is , sir .\\nyes , in truth it is , sir .\\nwhat is it , my good friends ?\\ngoodman verges , sir , speaks a little off the matter .\\nit pleases your worship to say so , but we are the poor duke\\'s officers .\\nbut truly , for mine own part , if i were as tedious as a king , i could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship .\\nall thy tediousness on me , ah ?\\nyea , an \\'twere a thousand

.\\none word , sir .\\ntake their examination yourself and bring it me .\\ni am now in great haste , as it may appear unto you .\\nfare you well .\\nmy lord , they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband .\\ni am ready .\\ngo , good partner , go , get you to francis seacole .\\nbid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail .\\nwe will spare for no wit , i warrant you .\\nhere\\'s that

, leonato .\\nwe will go together .\\nbenedick , didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato ?\\ni noted her not , but i looked on her .\\nis she not a modest young lady ?\\ndo you question me as an honest man should do , for my simple true judgment ?\\nor would you have me speak after my custom , as being a professed tyrant to their sex ?\\nno , i pray thee speak in sober judgment .\\nwhy , i \\' faith , methinks she\\'s too low for a high praise , too brown for a fair praise , and too little for a great praise .\\nonly this commendation i can afford her , that were she other than she is , she were unhandsome , and being no other but as she is , i do not like her .\\nthou thinkest i am in sport .\\ni pray thee tell me truly how thou lik\\'st her .\\ncome , friar francis , be brief , only to the plain form of marriage , and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards .\\nno .\\nlady , you come hither to be married to this count ?\\ni do .\\nif either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined , charge you on your souls to utter it .\\nknow you any , hero ?\\nnone , my lord .\\nknow you any , count ?\\ni dare make his answer , none .\\no , what men dare do !\\nwhat men may do !\\nwhat men daily do , not knowing what they do !\\nhow now , interjections ?\\nwhy , then , some be of laughing , as , ah , ha , he !\\nas freely , son , as god did give her me .\\nand what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?\\nnothing , unless you render her again .\\nsweet prince , you learn me noble thankfulness. , there , leonato , take her back again .\\nshe\\'s but the sign and semblance of her honor .\\nbehold how like a maid she blushes here !\\noh , what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal !\\ncomes not that blood as modest evidence to witness simple virtue ?\\nwould you not swear , all you that see her , that she were a maid by these exterior shows ?\\nbut she is none .\\nshe knows the heat of a luxurious bed .\\nher blush is guiltiness , not modesty .\\nwhat do you mean , my lord ?\\ndear my lord , if you in your own proof have vanquished the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginity , i know what you would say : if i have known her , you will say she did embrace me as a husband , and so extenuate the forehand sin .\\nand seemed i ever otherwise to you ?\\nout on thee , seeming !\\nis my lord well , that he doth speak so wide ?\\nsweet prince , why speak not you ?\\nwhat should i speak ?\\ni stand dishonored , that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale .\\nare these things spoken , or do i but dream ?\\nsir , they are spoken , and these things are true .\\nthis looks not like a nuptial .\\ntrue !\\no god !\\nleonato , stand i here ?\\nis this the prince ?\\nis this the prince\\'s brother ?\\nis this face hero\\'s ?\\nare our eyes our own ?\\nall this is so , but what of this , my lord ?\\nlet me but move one question to your daughter , and by that fatherly and kindly power that you have in her , bid her answer truly .\\ni charge thee do so , as thou art my child .\\noh , god defend me !\\nhow am i beset ! , what kind of catechizing call you this ?\\nto make you answer truly to your name .\\nis it not hero ?\\nwho can blot that name with any just reproach ?\\nmarry , that can hero !\\nhero itself can blot out hero\\'s virtue .\\nwhat man was he talked with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelve and one ?\\nnow , if you are a maid , answer to this .\\ni talked with no man at that hour , my lord .\\nupon mine honor , myself , my brother , and this grieved count did see her , hear her , at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed , most like a liberal villain , confessed the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret .\\nthere is not chastity enough in language , without offense , to utter them. , thus , pretty lady , i am sorry for thy much misgovernment .\\nwhy , how now , cousin !\\nwherefore sink you down ?\\ncome , let us go .\\nthese things , come thus to light , smother her spirits up .\\nhow doth the lady ?\\ndead , i think. , help , uncle ! , hero , why , hero !\\nuncle !\\nsignor benedick !\\nfriar !\\ndeath is the fairest cover for her shame that may be wished for .\\nhow now , cousin hero !\\nyea , wherefore should she not ?\\nwherefore !\\nwhy , doth not every earthly thing cry shame upon her ?\\ngrieved i i had but one ?\\nchid i for that at frugal nature\\'s frame ?\\no , one too much by thee !\\nwhy had i one ?\\nwhy ever wast thou lovely in my eyes ?\\nwhy had i not with charitable hand took up a beggar\\'s issue at my gates , who , smirched thus , and mired with infamy , i might have said , \"no part of it is mine ; this shame derives itself from unknown loins\" ?\\nsir , sir , be patient .\\nfor my part , i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say .\\noh , on my soul , my cousin is belied !\\nlady , were you her bedfellow last night ?\\nno , truly not , although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .\\nconfirmed , confirmed !\\ni have marked a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face , a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes , and in her eye there hath appeared a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth .\\nfriar , it can not be .\\nthou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she will not add to her damnation a sin of perjury .\\nthere is some strange misprision in the princes .\\ntwo of them have the very bent of honor , and if their wisdoms be misled in this , the practice of it lives in john the bastard , whose spirits toil in frame of villainies .\\ni know not .\\nif they speak but truth of her , these hands shall tear her ; if they wrong her honor , the proudest of them shall well hear of it .\\ntime hath not yet so dried this blood of mine nor age so eat up my invention nor fortune made such havoc of my means nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall find , awaked in such a kind , both strength of limb and policy of mind , ability in means and choice of friends , to quit me of them throughly .\\npause awhile , and let my counsel sway you in this case .\\nyour daughter here the princes left for dead .\\nlet her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed .\\nmaintain a mourning ostentation , and on your family\\'s old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial .\\nwhat shall become of this ?\\nwhat will this do ?\\nthat is some good .\\nshe , dying , as it must so be maintained , upon the instant that she was accused , shall be lamented , pitied and excused of every hearer .\\nso will it fare with claudio .\\nbut if all aim but this be leveled false , the supposition of the lady\\'s death will quench the wonder of her infamy .\\nand if it sort not well , you may conceal her , as best befits her wounded reputation , in some reclusive and religious life , out of all eyes , tongues , minds , and injuries .\\nsignior leonato , let the friar advise you .\\nand though you know my inwardness and love is very much unto the prince and claudio , yet , by mine honor , i will deal in this as secretly and justly as your soul should with your body .\\nwould you buy her , that you enquire after her ?\\nbut speak you this with a sad brow ?\\nor do you play the flouting jack , to tell us cupid is a good hare-finder and vulcan a rare carpenter ?\\ncome , in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?\\nin mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on .\\ni can see yet without spectacles , and i see no such matter .\\nbut i hope you have no intent to turn husband , have you ?\\ni would scarce trust myself , though i had sworn the contrary , if hero would be my wife .\\nis \\'t come to this ?\\nin faith , hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion ?\\nlook , don pedro is returned to seek you .\\ntis well consented .\\npresently away , for to strange sores strangely they strain the cure. , come , lady , die to live .\\nthis wedding day perhaps is but prolonged .\\nhave patience and endure .\\nlady beatrice , have you wept all this while ?\\nyea , and i will weep a while longer .\\ni will not desire that .\\nsurely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged .\\nah , how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !\\nis there any way to show such friendship ?\\na very even way , but no such friend .\\nmay a man do it ?\\nit is a man\\'s office , but not yours .\\ni do love nothing in the world so well as you .\\nis not that strange ?\\nas strange as the thing i know not .\\ni am sorry for my cousin .\\nby my sword , beatrice , thou lovest me .\\nwith no sauce that can be devised to it .\\ni protest i love thee .\\nwhy then , god forgive me .\\nwhat offense , sweet beatrice ?\\nyou have stayed me in a happy hour .\\ni was about to protest i loved you .\\nand do it with all thy heart .\\ni love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .\\ncome , bid me do anything for thee .\\nkill claudio .\\nha !\\nnot for the wide world .\\nyou kill me to deny it .\\ntarry , sweet beatrice .\\ni am gone , though i am here .\\nthere is no love in you .\\nnay , i pray you let me go .\\nbeatrice , in faith , i will go .\\nwe\\'ll be friends first .\\nyou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy .\\nis claudio thine enemy ?\\nis he not approved in the height a villain , that hath slandered , scorned , dishonored my kinswoman ?\\noh , that i were a man !\\nwhat , bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then , with public accusation , uncovered slander , unmitigated rancor , o god , that i were a man !\\ni would eat his heart in the marketplace .\\nhear me , beatrice , talk with a man out at a window !\\na proper saying !\\nnay , but beatrice , sweet hero , she is wronged , she is slandered , she is undone .\\nbeat ,\\nprinces and counties !\\nsurely , a

.\\nall , all .\\nand , moreover , god saw him when he was hid in the garden .\\nbut when shall we set the savage bull\\'s horns on the sensible benedick\\'s head ?\\nyea , and text underneath : \"here dwells benedick the married man\" ?\\nfare you well , boy .\\nyou know my mind .\\ni will leave you now to your gossip-like humor .\\nyou break jests as braggarts do their blades , which , god be thanked , hurt not. , my lord , for your many courtesies i thank you .\\ni must discontinue your company .\\nyour brother the bastard is fled from messina .\\nyou have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady .\\nfor my lord lackbeard there , he and i shall meet , and till then peace be with him .\\nhe is in earnest .\\nin most profound earnest , and , i\\'ll warrant you , for the love of beatrice .\\nand hath challenged thee ?\\nmost sincerely .\\nwhat a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit !\\nhe is then a giant to an ape ; but then is an ape a doctor to such a man .\\nbut soft you , let me be .\\npluck up , my heart , and be sad .\\ndid he not say my brother was fled ?\\ncome you , sir .\\nif justice can not tame you , she shall ne\\'er weigh more reasons in her balance .\\nnay , an you be a cursing hypocrite once , you must be looked to .\\nhow now ?\\ntwo of my brother\\'s men bound !\\nofficers , what offense have these men done ?\\nmarry , sir , they have committed false report ; moreover , they have spoken untruths ; secondarily , they are slanders ; sixth and lastly , they have belied a lady ; thirdly , they have verified unjust things ; and , to conclude , they are lying knaves .\\nfirst , i ask thee what they have done ; thirdly , i ask thee what\\'s their offense ; sixth and lastly , why they are committed ; and , to conclude , what you lay to their charge .\\ni have deceived even your very eyes .\\nmy villainy they have upon record , which i had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame .\\nthe lady is dead upon mine and my master\\'s false accusation .\\ni have drunk poison whiles he uttered it .\\nyea , and paid me richly for the practice of it .\\nhe is composed and framed of treachery , and fled he is upon this villainy .\\nsweet hero , now thy image doth appear in the rare semblance that i loved it first .\\nhere , here comes master signior leonato , and the sexton too .\\nwhich is the villain ?\\nlet me see his eyes , that , when i note another man like him , i may avoid him .\\nwhich of these is he ?\\nif you would know your wronger , look on me .\\nart thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed mine innocent child ?\\nyea , even i alone .\\nno , not so , villain , thou beliest thyself .\\ni know not how to pray your patience , yet i must speak .\\nchoose your revenge yourself .\\ni can not bid you bid my daughter live , that were impossible , but , i pray you both , possess the people in messina here how innocent she died .\\nand if your love can labor ought in sad invention , hang her an epitaph upon her tomb and sing it to her bones .\\nsing it tonight .\\ntomorrow morning come you to my house , and since you could not be my son-in-law , be yet my nephew .\\nmy brother hath a daughter , almost the copy of my child that\\'s dead , and she alone is heir to both of us .\\ngive her the right you should have given her cousin , and so dies my revenge .\\nthat i love her , i feel .\\nthat she is worthy , i know .\\nand never could maintain his part but in the force of his will .\\nthat a woman conceived me , i thank her .\\nthat she brought me up , i likewise give her most humble thanks .\\ni shall see thee , ere i die , look pale with love .\\nwith anger , with sickness , or with hunger , my lord , not with love .\\nprove that ever i lose more blood with love than i will get again with drinking , pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker\\'s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind cupid .\\no noble sir !\\nyour overkindness doth wring tears from me .\\ni do embrace your offer ; and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio .\\ntomorrow then i will expect your coming .\\ntonight i take my leave .\\nthis naughty man shall face to face be brought to margaret , who i believe was packed in all this wrong , hired to it by your brother .\\ni thank thee for thy care and honest pains .\\nyour worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth , and i praise god for you .\\ngod save the foundation !\\ni leave an arrant knave with your worship , which i beseech your worship to correct yourself , for the example of others .\\ngod keep your worship !\\ni wish your worship well .\\ngod restore you to health !\\nfarewell , my lords .\\nwe look for you tomorrow .\\nwe will not fail .\\ntonight i\\'ll mourn with hero .\\npray thee , sweet mistress margaret , deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of beatrice .\\nto have no man come over me !\\na most manly wit , margaret , it will not hurt a woman .\\nand so , i pray thee , call beatrice .\\nwell , i will call beatrice to you , who i think hath legs .\\nand therefore will come .\\ni mean in singing .\\nsweet beatrice , wouldst thou come when i called thee ?\\nyea , signior , and depart when you bid me .\\noh , stay but till then !\\nonly foul words , and thereupon i will kiss thee .\\nfoul words is but foul wind , and foul wind is but foul breath , and foul breath is noisome .\\ntherefore i will depart unkissed .\\nthou hast frighted the word out of his right sense , so forcible is thy wit .\\nbut i must tell thee plainly , claudio undergoes my challenge , and either i must shortly hear from him , or i will subscribe him a coward .\\nand i pray thee now tell me , for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me ?\\nfor them all together , which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them .\\nbut for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me ?\\nsuffer love !\\na good epithet !\\ni do suffer love indeed , for i love thee against my will .\\nin spite of your heart , i think .\\nif a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies , he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps .\\nand how long is that , think you ?\\nquestion : why , an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum .\\ntherefore is it most expedient for the wise , if don worm , his conscience , find no impediment to the contrary , to be the trumpet of his own virtues , as i am to myself .\\nso much for praising myself , who , i myself will bear witness , is praiseworthy .\\nan now tell me , how doth your cousin ?\\nvery ill , too .\\nserve god , love me , and mend .\\nmadam , you must come to your uncle .\\nit is proved my lady hero hath been falsely accused , the prince and claudio mightily abused , and don john is the author of all , who is fled and gone .\\nwill you come presently ?\\nwill you go hear this news , signior ?\\ni will live in thy heart , die in thy lap , and be buried in thy eyes , and moreover , i will go with thee to thy uncle\\'s .\\nis this the monument of leonato ?\\nit is , my lord .\\ndone to death by slanderous tongues was the hero that here lies .\\ndeath , in guerdon of her wrongs , gives her fame which never dies .\\nso the life that died with shame lives in death with glorious fame .\\nhang thou there upon the tomb , praising her when i am dumb .\\nnow , music , sound , and sing your solemn hymn .\\nnow , unto thy bones good night !\\nyearly will i do this rite .\\ngood morrow , masters .\\nput your torches out .\\nthe wolves have preyed , and look , the gentle day , before the wheels of phoebus , round about dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey .\\ngood morrow , masters .\\ndid i not tell you she was innocent ?\\nso are the prince and claudio , who accused her upon the error that you heard debated .\\nwell , i am glad that all things sort so well .\\nand so am i , being else by faith enforced to call young claudio to a reckoning for it .\\nwell , daughter , and you gentlewomen all , withdraw into a chamber by yourselves , and when i send for you , come hither masked .\\nthe prince and claudio promised by this hour to visit me. , you know your office , brother .\\nyou must be father to your brother\\'s daughter , and give her to young claudio .\\nto do what , signior ?\\nthat eye my daughter lent her ; \\'tis most true .\\nand i do with an eye of love requite her .\\nthe sight whereof i think you had from me , from claudio and the prince .\\nbut what\\'s your will ?\\nyour answer , sir , is enigmatical .\\nand my help .\\nhere comes the prince and claudio .\\ngood morrow to this fair assembly .\\ngood morrow , prince ; good morrow , claudio .\\nwe here attend you .\\nare you yet determined today to marry with my brother\\'s daughter ?\\ni\\'ll hold my mind were she an ethiope .\\nwell , as time shall try .\\nwell , you temporize with the hours .\\ncommend me to him and tell him i will not fail him at supper , for indeed he hath made great preparation .\\ncall her forth , brother .\\nhere\\'s the friar ready .\\ngood morrow , benedick .\\ni think he thinks upon the savage bull .\\ntush , fear not , man .\\nhere comes other reck\\'nings .\\nwhich is the lady i must seize upon ?\\nthis same is she , and i do give you her .\\nno , that you shall not till you take her hand before this friar and swear to marry her .\\nanother hero !\\nnothing certainer .\\none hero died defiled , but i do live , and surely as i live , i am a maid .\\nthe former hero !\\nhero that is dead !\\nshe died , my lord , but whiles her slander lived .\\nall this amazement can i qualify when after that the holy rites are ended i\\'ll tell you largely of fair hero\\'s death .\\nsoft and fair , friar. , which is beatrice ?\\ndo not you love me ?\\nwhy no , no more than reason .\\nwhy then , your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived .\\nthey swore you did .\\ndo not you love me ?\\ntroth , no , no more than reason .\\nwhy then , my cousin , margaret , and ursula are much deceived , for they did swear you did .\\nthey swore that you were almost sick for me .\\nthey swore that you were well-nigh dead for me .\\ntis no such matter .\\nthen you do not love me ?\\nno , truly , but in friendly recompense .\\ncome , cousin , i am sure you love the gentleman .\\nand here\\'s another , writ in my cousin\\'s hand , stol\\'n from her pocket , containing her affection unto benedick .\\na miracle !\\nhere\\'s our own hands against our hearts .\\ncome , i will have thee , but , by this light , i take thee for pity .\\ni would not deny you , but , by this good day , i yield upon great persuasion , and partly to save your life , for i was told you were in a consumption .\\npeace !\\ni will stop your mouth .\\nhow dost thou , benedick , the married man ?\\ni\\'ll tell thee what , prince : a college of wit-crackers can not flout me out of my humor .\\ndost thou think i care for a satire or an epigram ?\\nno .\\nfirst , of my word !\\ntherefore play , music. , prince , thou art sad .\\nget thee a wife , get thee a wife .\\nto the tuition of god .\\nfrom my house , if i had it , the sixth of july .\\nmy liege , your highness now may do me good .\\nmy love is thine to teach .\\nteach it but how , and thou shalt see how apt it is to learn any hard lesson that may do thee good .\\nhath leonato any son , my lord ?\\nno child but hero ; she\\'s his only heir .\\ndost thou affect her , claudio ?\\nif thou dost love fair hero , cherish it , and i will break with her and with her father , and thou shalt have her .\\nwas \\'t not to this end that thou began\\'st to twist so fine a story ?\\nbut lest my liking might too sudden seem , i would have salved it with a longer treatise .\\nwhat need the bridge much broader than the flood ?\\ni will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair hero i am claudio , and in her bosom i\\'ll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale .\\nin practice let us put it presently .\\nhath he provided this music ?\\nhe is very busy about it .\\nbut , brother , i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .\\nare they good ?\\nhath the fellow any wit that told you this ?\\na good sharp fellow .\\ni will send for him , and question him yourself .\\nhe is very near by this .\\nhe was not three leagues off when i left him .\\nhow many gentlemen have you lost in this action ?\\nbut few of any sort , and none of name .\\na victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers .\\ni find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio .\\nhe hath an uncle here in messina will be very much glad of it .\\nno , no , we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself .\\nbut i will acquaint my daughter withal , that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true .\\ngo you and tell her of it .\\ncousins , you know what you have to do. , o , i cry you mercy , friend .\\ngo you with me and i will use your skill. , good cousin , have a care this busy time .\\nwhat the goodyear , my lord , why are you thus out of measure sad ?\\ntherefore the sadness is without limit .\\nyou should hear reason .\\ni can not hide what i am .\\nyea , but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment .\\nyou have of late stood out against your brother , and he hath ta\\'en you newly into his grace , where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .\\nit is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest .\\ni had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace , and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any .\\nin this , though i can not be said to be a flattering honest man , it must not be denied but i am a plain-dealing villain .\\nin the meantime , let me be that i am , and seek not to alter me .\\ncan you make no use of your discontent ?\\ni make all use of it , for i use it only .\\nwho comes here ?\\nwhat news , borachio ?\\nwhat is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness ?\\nmarry , it is your brother\\'s right hand .\\nwho ?\\nthe most exquisite claudio ?\\neven he .\\nmarry , on hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .\\na very forward march-chick !\\nhow came you to this ?\\nbeing entertained for a perfumer , as i was smoking a musty room , comes me the prince and claudio , hand in hand , in sad conference .\\ncome , come , let us thither .\\nthis may prove food to my displeasure .\\nif i can cross him any way , i bless myself every way .\\nyou are both sure , and will assist me ?\\nto the death , my lord .\\nlet us to the great supper .\\nwe\\'ll wait upon your lordship .\\nwas not count john here at supper ?\\ni saw him not .\\nhow tartly that gentleman looks !\\ni never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after .\\nhe is of a very melancholy disposition .\\nhe were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick .\\nthe one is too like an image and says nothing , and the other too like my lady\\'s eldest son , evermore tattling .\\nthen half signor benedick\\'s tongue in count john\\'s mouth , and half count john\\'s melancholy in signor benedick\\'s face , with a good leg and a good foot , uncle , and money enough in his purse , such a man would win any woman in the world , if he could get her goodwill .\\nby my troth , niece , thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue .\\nin faith , she\\'s too curst .\\nyou may light on a husband that hath no beard .\\nwhat should i do with him ?\\nwell then , go you into hell ?\\nno , but to the gate , and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head , and say , \"get you to heaven , beatrice , get you to heaven ; here\\'s no place for you maids.\" so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter .\\nfor the heavens , he shows me where the bachelors sit , and there live we as merry as the day is long .\\nnot till god make men of some other metal than earth .\\nwould it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust ?\\nto make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl ?\\nno , uncle , i\\'ll none .\\nif the prince be too important , tell him there is measure in everything , and so dance out the answer .\\nfor hear me , hero , wooing , wedding , and repenting is as a scotch jig , a measure , and a cinquepace .\\ncousin , you apprehend passing shrewdly .\\ni have a good eye , uncle .\\ni can see a church by daylight .\\nthe revelers are entering , brother .\\nmake good room .\\nlady , will you walk a bout with your friend ?\\nso you walk softly , and look sweetly , and say nothing , i am yours for the walk , and especially when i walk away .\\nand when please you to say so ?\\nwhen i like your favor , for god defend the lute should be like the case !\\nmy visor is philemon\\'s roof ; within the house is jove .\\nspeak low if you speak love .\\nwell , i would you did like me .\\nwhich is one ?\\ni say my prayers aloud .\\ni love you the better ; the hearers may cry \"amen.\" god match me with a good dancer !\\namen .\\nno more words .\\nthe clerk is answered .\\nat a word , i am not .\\ni know you by the waggling of your head .\\nto tell you true , i counterfeit him .\\nyou could never do him so ill-well unless you were the very man .\\nhere\\'s his dry hand up and down .\\nyou are he , you are he .\\nat a word , i am not .\\ncome , come , do you think i do not know you by your excellent wit ?\\ncan virtue hide itself ?\\ngo to , mum , you are he .\\ngraces will appear , and there\\'s an end .\\nwill you not tell me who told you so ?\\nno , you shall pardon me .\\nnor will you not tell me who you are ?\\nnot now .\\nthat i was disdainful and that i had my good wit out of the hundred merry tales !\\nwell this was signor benedick that said so .\\nwhat\\'s he ?\\ni am sure you know him well enough .\\nnot i , believe me .\\ndid he never make you laugh ?\\nin great measure .\\nthere are no faces truer than those that are so washed .\\nhow much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping !\\nthere was none such in the army of any sort .\\nwhat is he that you ask for , niece ?\\nmy cousin means signor benedick of padua .\\noh , he\\'s returned , and as pleasant as ever he was .\\ni pray you , what is he ?\\nwhy , he is the prince\\'s jester , a very dull fool , only his gift is in devising impossible slanders .\\ni am sure he is in the fleet .\\ni would he had boarded me .\\nwhen i know the gentleman , i\\'ll tell him what you say .\\ndo , do .\\nhe\\'ll but break a comparison or two on me , which , peradventure not marked or not laughed at , strikes him into melancholy , and then there\\'s a partridge wing saved , for the fool will eat no supper that night .\\nwe must follow the leaders .\\nin every good thing .\\nnay , if they lead to any ill , i will leave them at the next turning .\\nand that is claudio .\\nyou know me well .\\ni am he .\\nsignor , you are very near my brother in his love .\\nhe is enamored on hero .\\ni pray you , dissuade him from her .\\nhow know you he loves her ?\\ni heard him swear his affection .\\nso did i too , and he swore he would marry her tonight .\\ncome , let us to the banquet .\\nthus answer i in the name of benedick , but hear these ill news with the ears of claudio .\\ntis certain so , the prince woos for himself .\\nfriendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love .\\ntherefore all hearts in love use their own tongues .\\nlet every eye nogetiate for itself and trust no agent , for beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melteth into blood .\\nfarewell , therefore , hero .\\ncount claudio ?\\nyea , the same .\\ncome , will you go with me ?\\nwhither ?\\ni wish him joy of her .\\nwhy , that\\'s spoken like an honest drover ; so they sell bullocks .\\nbut did you think the prince would have served you thus ?\\ni pray you , leave me .\\nho , now you strike like the blind man .\\ntwas the boy that stole your meat , and you\\'ll beat the post .\\nif it will not be , i\\'ll leave you .\\nalas , poor hurt fowl , now will he creep into sedges .\\nbut that my lady beatrice should know me , and not know me !\\nthe prince\\'s fool !\\nha , it may be i go under that title because i am merry .\\nyea , but so i am apt to do myself wrong .\\ni am not so reputed !\\nwell , i\\'ll be revenged as i may .\\nnow , signior , where\\'s the count ?\\ndid you see him ?\\ntroth , my lord , i have played the part of lady fame .\\ni found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren .\\nwhat\\'s his fault ?\\nthe flat transgression of a schoolboy who , being overjoyed with finding a birds \\' nest , shows it his companion , and he steals it .\\nwilt thou make a trust a transgression ?\\nthe transgression is in the stealer .\\nthe lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you .\\nthe gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .\\nshe speaks poniards , and every word stabs .\\nif her breath were as terrible as her terminations , there were no living near her ; she would infect to the north star .\\ni would not marry her , though she were endowed with all that adam had left him before he transgressed .\\ncome , talk not of her .\\nlook , here she comes .\\nwill your grace command me any service to the world\\'s end ?\\ni will go on the slightest errand now to the antipodes that you can devise to send me on .\\nmarry , once before he won it of me with false dice .\\ntherefore your grace may well say i have lost it .\\nyou have put him down , lady , you have put him down .\\nwhy , how now , count , wherefore are you sad ?\\nnot sad , my lord .\\nhow then , sick ?\\nneither , my lord .\\nthe count is neither sad , nor sick , nor merry , nor well , but civil count , civil as an orange , and something of that jealous complexion .\\ni have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained .\\nname the day of marriage , and god give thee joy .\\ncount , take of me my daughter , and with her my fortunes .\\nhis grace hath made the match , and all grace say \"amen\" to it .\\nspeak , count , \\'tis your cue .\\ni give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .\\nin faith , lady , you have a merry heart .\\nyea , my lord .\\ni thank it , poor fool , it keeps on the windy side of care .\\nmy cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .\\nand so she doth , cousin .\\ngood lord for alliance !\\nthus goes everyone to the world but i , and i am sunburnt .\\ni may sit in a corner and cry , \"heigh-ho for a husband ! \" lady beatrice , i will get you one .\\ni would rather have one of your father\\'s getting .\\nhath your grace ne\\'er a brother like you ?\\nyour father got excellent husbands , if a maid could come by them .\\nwill you have me , lady ?\\nno , my lord , unless i might have another for working days .\\nyour grace is too costly to wear every day .\\nbut i beseech your grace pardon me .\\ni was born to speak all mirth and no matter .\\nniece , will you look to those things i told you of ?\\ni cry you mercy , uncle. , by your grace\\'s pardon .\\nby my troth , a pleasant-spirited lady .\\nthere\\'s little of the melancholy element in her , my lord .\\nshe is never sad but when she sleeps , and not ever sad then , for i have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing .\\nshe can not endure to hear tell of a husband .\\noh , by no means .\\nshe mocks all her wooers out of suit .\\nshe were an excellent wife for benedict .\\no lord , my lord , if they were but a week married , they would talk themselves mad .\\ncounty claudio , when mean you to go to church ?\\ntomorrow , my lord .\\nmy lord , i am for you , though it cost me ten nights \\' watchings .\\nand i , my lord .\\nand you too , gentle hero ?\\ni will do any modest office , my lord , to help my cousin to a good husband .\\nand benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that i know .\\nthus far can i praise him : he is of a noble strain , of approved valor , and confirmed honesty .\\ngo in with me , and i will tell you my drift .\\nfaith , niece , you tax signor benedick too much , but he\\'ll be meet with you , i doubt it not .\\nhe hath done good service , lady , in these wars .\\nyou had musty victual , and he hath holp to eat it .\\nand a good soldier too , lady .\\na lord to a lord , a man to a man , stuffed with all honorable virtues .\\nhe is no less than a stuffed man .\\nbut for the stuffing , well , we are all mortal .\\nyou must not , sir , mistake my niece .\\nthere is a kind of merry war betwixt signor benedick and her .\\nthey never meet but there\\'s a skirmish of wit between them .\\nhe hath every month a new sworn brother .\\nis \\'t possible ?\\nit is so .\\nthe count claudio shall marry the daughter of leonato .\\nyea , my lord , but i can cross it .\\nany bar , any cross , any impediment will be med\\'cinable to me .\\ni am sick in displeasure to him , and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine .\\nhow canst thou cross this marriage ?\\nnot honestly , my lord , but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me .\\nshow me briefly how .\\ni think i told your lordship a year since how much i am in the favor of margaret , the waiting gentlewoman to hero .\\ni remember .\\ni can , at any unseasonable instant of the night , appoint her to look out at her lady\\'s chamber window .\\nwhat life is in that to be the death of this marriage ?\\nthe poison of that lies in you to temper .\\nwhat proof shall i make of that ?\\nproof enough to misuse the prince , to vex claudio , to undo hero , and kill leonato .\\nlook you for any other issue ?\\nonly to despite them , i will endeavor anything .\\ngo then , find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone .\\ntell them that you know that hero loves me .\\nintend a kind of zeal both to the prince and claudio , as in love of your brother\\'s honor , who hath made this match , and his friend\\'s reputation , who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid , that you have discovered thus .\\nthey will scarcely believe this without trial .\\nbe you constant in the accusation , and my cunning shall not shame me .\\ni will presently go learn their day of marriage .\\nboy !\\nsignior ?\\nin my chamber window lies a book .\\nbring it hither to me in the orchard .\\ni am here already , sir .\\ni know that , but i would have thee hence and here again .\\ni have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife , and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe .\\ni have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor , and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet .\\ni can not tell ; i think not .\\ni will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster , but i\\'ll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool .\\nha !\\nthe prince and monsieur love !\\ni will hide me in the arbor .\\ncome , shall we hear this music ?\\nyea , my good lord .\\ncome , balthasar , we\\'ll hear that song again .\\no , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice to slander music anymore than once .\\ni pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more .\\nnote this before my notes : there\\'s not a note of mine that\\'s worth the noting .\\nstrange that sheeps \\' guts should hale souls out of men\\'s bodies ?\\nby my troth , a good song .\\nand an ill singer , my lord .\\nyea , marry , dost thou hear , balthasar ?\\ni pray thee , get us some excellent music , for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady hero\\'s chamber window\\nthe best i can , my lord .\\ndo so .\\nfarewell .\\ncome hither , leonato .\\nwhat was it you told me of today , that your niece beatrice was in love with signor benedick ?\\noh , ay .\\nsits. , i did never think that lady would have loved any man .\\nno , nor i neither , but most wonderful that she should so dote on signor benedick , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor .\\nby my troth , my lord , i can not tell what to think of it , but that she loves him with an enraged affection , it is past the infinite of thought .\\nmay be she doth but counterfeit .\\nfaith , like enough .\\no god !\\ncounterfeit ?\\nthere was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it .\\nwhy , what effects of passion shows she ?\\nwhat effects , my lord ?\\nshe will sit you , you heard my daughter tell you how .\\nshe did indeed .\\nhow , how i pray you ?\\nyou amaze me .\\ni would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection .\\ni would have sworn it had , my lord , especially against benedick .\\nhath she made her affection known to benedick ?\\nno , and swears she never will .\\nthat\\'s her torment .\\ntis true indeed , so your daughter says .\\nmy daughter tells us all .\\nnow you talk of a sheet of paper , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told .\\noh , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found \"benedick\" and \"beatrice\" between the sheet ?\\nthat .\\no , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence , railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her .\\nit is very true .\\nit were good that benedick knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it .\\nto what end ?\\nhe would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .\\nan he should , it were an alms to hang him .\\nshe\\'s an excellent sweet lady , and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous .\\nand she is exceeding wise .\\noh , my lord , wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body , we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory .\\ni am sorry for her , as i have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian .\\ni would she had bestowed this dotage on me .\\ni would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself .\\ni pray you tell benedick of it and hear what he will say .\\nwere it good , think you ?\\nhero thinks surely she will die , for she says she will die if he love her not , and she will die ere she make her love known , and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness .\\nshe doth well .\\nif she should make tender of her love , \\'tis very possible he\\'ll scorn it , for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit .\\nhe is a very proper man .\\nbefore god , and in my mind , very wise .\\nhe doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit .\\nvery easily possible .\\ni see , lady , the gentleman is not in your books .\\nno .\\nbut i pray you , who is his companion ?\\nhe is most in the company of the right noble claudio .\\no lord , he will hang upon him like a disease !\\ngod help the noble claudio !\\nif he have caught the benedick , it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured .\\ni will hold friends with you , lady .\\ndo , good friend .\\nyou will never run mad , niece .\\nno , not till a hot january .\\ndon pedro is approached .\\nif he do fear god , he must necessarily keep peace .\\nif he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .\\nwell , i am sorry for your niece .\\nshall we go seek benedick and tell him of her love ?\\nagainst my will , i am sent to bid you come in to dinner .\\nfair beatrice , i thank you for your pains .\\ni took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me .\\nif it had been painful , i would not have come .\\nyou take pleasure then in the message ?\\nyea , just so much as you may take upon a knife\\'s point and choke a daw withal .\\nyou have no stomach , signior .\\nfare you well .\\nha !\\nagainst my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner.\" there\\'s a double meaning in that .\\ni took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.\" that\\'s as much as to say , \"any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks.\" if i do not take pity of her , i am a villain .\\nif i do not love her , i am a jew .\\ngood margaret , run thee to the parlor .\\nthere shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio .\\nwhisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard , and our whole discourse is all of her .\\nsay that thou overheardst us , and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripened by the sun forbid the sun to enter , like favorites made proud by princes , that advance their pride against that power that bred it .\\nthere will she hide her to listen our propose .\\nthis is thy office .\\nbear thee well in it and leave us alone .\\ni\\'ll make her come , i warrant you , presently .\\nnow , ursula , when beatrice doth come , as we do trace this alley up and down , our talk must only be of benedick .\\nwhen i do name him , let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit .\\nmy talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice .\\nfear you not my part of the dialogue .\\nbut are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely ?\\nso says the prince and my new-trothed lord .\\nand did they bid you tell her of it , madam ?\\nthey did entreat me to acquaint her of it , but i persuaded them , if they loved benedick , to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it .\\nwhy did you so ?\\ndoth not the gentleman deserve as full as fortunate a bed as ever beatrice shall couch upon ?\\nwhat\\'s the matter , lieutenant ?\\ni\\'ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .\\nbeat me ?\\ndost thou prate , rogue ?\\nnay , good lieutenant !\\ni pray you , sir , hold your hand .\\nlet me go , sir , or i\\'ll knock you o\\'er the mazzard .\\ncome , come , you\\'re drunk .\\ndrunk ?\\nalas , gentlemen , help , ho ! , lieutenant , sir , montano , help , masters ! , here\\'s a goodly watch indeed !\\nwho\\'s that which rings the bell ? , diablo , ho !\\nthe town will rise .\\nfie , fie , lieutenant , you\\'ll be ashamed for ever .\\nwhat is the matter here ?\\nhe dies !\\nhold , for your lives !\\nhold , ho !\\nhold !\\nthe general speaks to you .\\nhold , for shame !\\nfor christian shame , put by this barbarous brawl .\\nhe that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light , he dies upon his motion .\\nsilence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle from her propriety .\\nwhat is the matter , masters ? , honest iago , that looks dead with grieving , speak , who began this ?\\non thy love , i charge thee .\\ni do not know .\\nswords out , and tilting one at other\\'s breasts in opposition bloody .\\ni can not speak any beginning to this peevish odds , and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it .\\nworthy montano , you were wont be civil .\\nwhat\\'s the matter that you unlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a night-brawler ?\\ngive me answer to it .\\nworthy othello , i am hurt to danger .\\nnor know i aught by me that\\'s said or done amiss this night , unless self-charity be sometimes a vice , and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us .\\nnow , by heaven , my blood begins my safer guides to rule , and passion , having my best judgment collied , assays to lead the way .\\ntis monstrous .\\niago , who began \\'t ?\\ntouch me not so near .\\ni had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offence to michael cassio .\\nyet i persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him .\\nwhen i came back , for this was brief , i found them close together at blow and thrust , even as again they were when you yourself did part them .\\nmore of this matter can not i report .\\nthough cassio did some little wrong to him , as men in rage strike those that wish them best , yet surely cassio , i believe , received from him that fled some strange indignity which patience could not pass .\\ni\\'ll make thee an example .\\nwhat\\'s the matter , dear ?\\nall\\'s well , sweeting , come away to bed. , myself will be your surgeon .\\nwhat , are you hurt , lieutenant ?\\nay , past all surgery .\\nmarry , heaven forbid !\\nbut thou must needs be sure my spirits and my place have in their power to make this bitter to thee .\\npatience , good sir .\\nwhat tell\\'st thou me of robbing ?\\nbecause we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you\\'ll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse .\\nyou\\'ll have your nephews neigh to you .\\nyou\\'ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .\\nwhat profane wretch art thou ?\\ni am one , sir , that comes to tell you your daughter and the moor are now making the beast with two backs .\\nthou art a villain !\\nyou are a senator !\\nthis thou shalt answer .\\ni know thee , roderigo .\\nsir , i will answer any thing .\\nreputation , reputation , reputation !\\nmy reputation , iago , my reputation !\\nas i am an honest man , i thought you had received some bodily wound .\\nthere is more sense in that than in reputation .\\nyou have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser .\\nwhat , man , there are ways to recover the general again .\\nsue to him again and he\\'s yours .\\ndrunk ?\\nand speak parrot ?\\nand squabble ?\\nswagger ?\\nand discourse fustian with one\\'s own shadow ?\\no thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !\\nwhat was he that you followed with your sword ?\\nwhat had he done to you ?\\ni know not .\\nis \\'t possible ?\\ni remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly .\\na quarrel , but nothing wherefore .\\nthat we should , with joy , pleasance revel and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !\\nwhy , but you are now well enough .\\nhow came you thus recovered ?\\none unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .\\ncome , you are too severe a moraler .\\nas the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , i could heartily wish this had not befallen .\\nbut since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .\\ni will ask him for my place again , he shall tell me i am a drunkard .\\nhad i as many mouths as hydra , such an answer would stop them all .\\nto be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast !\\noh , strange !\\nevery inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .\\ncome , come , good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used .\\nexclaim no more against it .\\nand , good lieutenant , i think you think i love you .\\ni have well approved it , sir .\\ni drunk !\\nyou or any man living may be drunk at a time , man .\\ni tell you what you shall do .\\nour general\\'s wife is now the general .\\nconfess yourself freely to her , importune her help to put you in your place again .\\nshe is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested .\\nthis broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter , and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .\\nyou advise me well .\\ni protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .\\ni think it freely , and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me .\\ni am desperate of my fortunes if they check me .\\nyou are in the right .\\ngood night , lieutenant , i must to the watch .\\ngood night , honest iago .\\nand what\\'s he then that says i play the villain ?\\nwhen this advice is free i give and honest , probal to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again ?\\nfor \\'tis most easy th \\' inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit .\\nshe\\'s framed as fruitful as the free elements .\\nhow am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course , directly to his good ?\\nwhen devils will the blackest sins put on they do suggest at first with heavenly shows as i do now .\\nand by how much she strives to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor .\\nso will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all .\\nhow now , roderigo !\\nmy money is almost spent , i have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled , and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains .\\nand so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to venice .\\nhow poor are they that have not patience !\\nwhat wound did ever heal but by degrees ?\\nthou know\\'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft , and wit depends on dilatory time .\\ndoes\\'t not go well ?\\nin troth , \\'tis morning .\\npleasure and action make the hours seem short .\\nretire thee , go where thou art billeted .\\nnay , get thee gone .\\ntwo things are to be done : my wife must move for cassio to her mistress .\\ni\\'ll set her on .\\nay , that\\'s the way .\\nmasters , play here , i will content your pains .\\nare these , i pray you , wind instruments ?\\nay , marry , are they , sir .\\noh , thereby hangs a tail .\\nwhereby hangs a tale , sir ?\\nwell , sir , we will not .\\nif you have any music that may not be heard , to \\'t again .\\nbut , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .\\nwe have none such , sir .\\nthen put up your pipes in your bag , for i\\'ll away .\\ngo , vanish into air , away !\\ndost thou hear , my honest friend ?\\nprithee , keep up thy quillets .\\nshe is stirring , sir .\\nif she will stir hither , i shall seem to notify unto her .\\nin happy time , iago .\\nyou have not been abed , then ?\\nwhy , no .\\nmy suit to her is that she will to virtuous desdemona procure me some access .\\ni humbly thank you for\\'t .\\ngood morrow , good lieutenant .\\ni am sorry for your displeasure , but all will sure be well .\\nthe general and his wife are talking of it , and she speaks for you stoutly .\\nthe moor replies that he you hurt is of great fame in cyprus and great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom he might not but refuse you .\\nbut he protests he loves you and needs no other suitor but his likings to take the safest occasion by the front to bring you in again .\\nyet i beseech you , if you think fit , or that it may be done , give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone .\\npray you come in .\\ni will bestow you where you shall have time to speak your bosom freely .\\ni am much bound to you .\\nthese letters give , iago , to the pilot , and by him do my duties to the senate .\\nthat done , i will be walking on the works , repair there to me .\\nwell , my good lord , i\\'ll do \\'t .\\nthis fortification , gentlemen , shall we see \\'t ?\\nwe\\'ll wait upon your lordship .\\nbe thou assured , good cassio , i will do all my abilities in thy behalf .\\ngood madam , do .\\ndo not doubt , cassio , but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were .\\nyou do love my lord .\\nay , but , lady , that policy may either last so long , or feed upon such nice and waterish diet , or breed itself so out of circumstances , that , i being absent and my place supplied , my general will forget my love and service .\\nmy lord shall never rest , i\\'ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience .\\nbut if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke .\\ndo not believe that , from the sense of all civility , i thus would play and trifle with your reverence .\\nif she be in her chamber or your house , let loose on me the justice of the state for thus deluding you .\\nstrike on the tinder , ho !\\ngive me a taper , call up all my people !\\nthis accident is not unlike my dream , belief of it oppresses me already .\\nlight , i say , light !\\nfarewell , for i must leave you .\\nit seems not meet , nor wholesome to my place , to be producted ( as , if i stay , i shall ) against the moor .\\nin which regard ,\\ntherefore be merry , cassio , for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .\\nmadam , here comes my lord .\\nmadam , i\\'ll take my leave .\\nwhy , stay and hear me speak .\\nmadam , not now .\\ni am very ill at ease , unfit for mine own purposes .\\nwell , do your discretion .\\nha !\\ni like not that .\\nwhat dost thou say ?\\nnothing , my lord , or if , i know not what .\\nwas not that cassio parted from my wife ?\\ncassio , my lord ?\\ni do believe \\'twas he .\\nhow now , my lord ?\\ni have been talking with a suitor here , a man that languishes in your displeasure .\\nwho is \\'t you mean ?\\nwhy , your lieutenant , cassio .\\ngood my lord , if i have any grace or power to move you his present reconciliation take .\\ni prithee , call him back .\\nwent he hence now ?\\nay , sooth , so humbled that he hath left part of his grief with me to suffer with him .\\ngood love , call him back .\\nnot now , sweet desdemona .\\nsome other time .\\nbut shall \\'t be shortly ?\\nthe sooner , sweet , for you .\\nshall \\'t be tonight at supper ?\\nno , not tonight .\\ntomorrow dinner , then ?\\nwhy , then , tomorrow night , or tuesday morn .\\non tuesday noon , or night , or wednesday morn .\\ni prithee name the time , but let it not exceed three days .\\nin faith , he\\'s penitent , and yet his trespass , in our common reason ( save that , they say , the wars must make example out of her best ) is not , almost , a fault t \\' incur a private check .\\nwhen shall he come ?\\ntell me , othello .\\ntrust me , i could do much , prithee , no more .\\nlet him come when he will , i will deny thee nothing .\\nwhy , this is not a boon , \\'t is as i should entreat you wear your gloves , or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm , or sue to you to do a peculiar profit to your own person .\\nnay , when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted .\\ni will deny thee nothing !\\nwhereon i do beseech thee , grant me this , to leave me but a little to myself .\\nshall i deny you ?\\nno .\\nfarewell , my lord .\\nfarewell , my desdemona .\\ni\\'ll come to thee straight .\\nperdition catch my soul but i do love thee !\\nmy noble lord , what dost thou say , iago ?\\ndid michael cassio , when you wooed my lady , know of your love ?\\nhe did , from first to last .\\nwhy dost thou ask ?\\nwhy of thy thought , iago ?\\ni did not think he had been acquainted with her .\\nindeed ?\\nindeed ?\\nay , indeed !\\ndiscern\\'st thou aught in that ?\\nis he not honest ?\\nhonest , my lord ?\\nhonest , ay , honest .\\nmy lord , for aught i know .\\nwhat dost thou think ?\\nthink , my lord ?\\nthink , my lord ? \" alas , thou echo\\'st me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shown .\\nthou dost mean something .\\ni heard thee say even now thou lik\\'st not that when cassio left my wife .\\nwhat didst not like ?\\nand when i told thee he was of my counsel of my whole course of wooing , thou cried\\'st \"indeed ? \" and didst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain some horrible conceit .\\nif thou dost love me show me thy thought .\\nmy lord , you know i love you .\\ni think thou dost .\\nfor michael cassio , i dare be sworn , i think , that he is honest .\\ni think so too .\\nmen should be what they seem , or those that be not , would they might seem none !\\ncertain , men should be what they seem .\\nwhy then i think cassio\\'s an honest man .\\nnay , yet there\\'s more in this .\\ni prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings , as thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts the worst of words .\\nutter my thoughts ?\\nthou dost conspire against thy friend , iago , if thou but think\\'st him wronged and mak\\'st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts .\\nwhat dost thou mean ?\\ngood name in man and woman , dear my lord , is the immediate jewel of their souls .\\nwho steals my purse steals trash .\\ntis something , nothing : \\'t was mine , \\'tis his , and has been slave to thousands .\\nbut he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed .\\ni\\'ll know thy thoughts .\\nyou can not , if my heart were in your hand , nor shall not , whilst \\'tis in my custody .\\nha !\\noh , beware , my lord , of jealousy !\\nit is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on .\\noh , misery !\\npoor and content is rich , and rich enough , but riches fineless is as poor as winter to him that ever fears he shall be poor .\\ngood heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy !\\nwhy , why is this ?\\nthink\\'st thou i\\'d make a life of jealousy , to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions ?\\nno !\\nto be once in doubt is to be resolved .\\ntis not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company , is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances .\\nwhere virtue is , these are more virtuous .\\ntherefore , as i am bound , receive it from me .\\ni speak not yet of proof .\\nlook to \\'t .\\ni know our country disposition well .\\nin venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands .\\ndost thou say so ?\\nand so she did .\\nwhy , go to then .\\nshe that , so young , could give out such a seeming , to seel her father\\'s eyes up close as oak , he thought \\'twas witchcraft .\\nbut i am much to blame .\\ni humbly do beseech you of your pardon for too much loving you .\\ni am bound to thee forever .\\ni see this hath a little dashed your spirits .\\nnot a jot , not a jot .\\ntrust me , i fear it has .\\ni hope you will consider what is spoke comes from my love .\\nbut i do see you\\'re moved .\\ni am to pray you not to strain my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach than to suspicion .\\ni will not .\\nshould you do so , my lord , my speech should fall into such vile success which my thoughts aimed not at .\\ncassio\\'s my worthy friend , my lord , i see you\\'re moved .\\nno , not much moved .\\nfarewell , farewell .\\nif more thou dost perceive , let me know more .\\nset on thy wife to observe .\\nleave me , iago .\\nmy lord , i take my leave .\\nnote if your lady strain his entertainment\\nthat you shall surely find him , lead to the sagittary the raised search , and there will i be with him .\\nit is too true an evil .\\ngone she is .\\nand what\\'s to come of my despised time is naught but bitterness .\\nnow , roderigo , where didst thou see her ? , oh , unhappy girl ! , with the moor , say\\'st thou ? , who would be a father ? , how didst thou know \\'twas she ? , oh , she deceives me past thought ! , what said she to you ? , get more tapers , raise all my kindred .\\nare they married , think you ?\\ntruly , i think they

her stol\\'n hours of lust ?\\ni saw \\'t not , thought it not , it harmed not me .\\ni slept the next night well , fed well , was free and merry .\\ni found not cassio\\'s kisses on her lips .\\nhe

farewell !\\nfarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump , the spirit-stirring drum , th \\' ear-piercing fife , the royal banner , and all quality , pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious

a soul or sense ?\\ngod buy you , take mine office .\\no monstrous world !\\ntake note , take note , o world , to be direct and honest is not safe .\\nnay , stay .\\nthou shouldst be honest .\\ni should be wise , for honesty\\'s a fool and loses that it works for .\\nby the world , i think my wife be honest and think she is not .\\ni think that thou art just and think thou art not .\\ni\\'ll have some proof .\\nher name , that was as fresh as dian\\'s visage , is now begrimed and black as mine own face .\\nwould i were satisfied !\\ni see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .\\ni do repent me that i put it to you .\\nyou would be satisfied ?\\nwould ?\\nnay , and i will .\\nand may , but how ?\\nhow satisfied , my lord ?\\nwould you , the supervisor , grossly gape on , behold her topped ?\\ndeath and damnation !\\noh !\\nit were a tedious difficulty , i think , to bring them to that prospect .\\nwhat shall i say ?\\nwhere\\'s satisfaction ?\\nit is impossible you should see this , were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys , as salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk .\\nbut yet , i say , if imputation and strong circumstances which lead directly to the door of truth will give you satisfaction , you may have \\'t .\\ngive me a living reason she\\'s disloyal .\\ni do not like the office .\\nbut , sith i am entered in this cause so far , pricked to \\'t by foolish honesty and love , i will go on .\\ni lay with cassio lately and , being troubled with a raging tooth , i could not sleep .\\nmonstrous !\\nnay , this was but his dream .\\ntis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .\\nand this may help to thicken other proofs that do demonstrate thinly .\\ni\\'ll tear her all to pieces !\\ntell me but this , have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife\\'s hand ?\\nif it be that , if it be that , or any that was hers , it speaks against her with the other proofs .\\noh , that the slave had forty thousand lives !\\none is too poor , too weak for my revenge .\\nnow do i see \\'tis true .\\nswell , bosom , with thy fraught , for \\'tis of aspics \\' tongues !\\npatience , i say .\\nyour mind may change .\\nnever , iago .\\nnow , by yon marble heaven , in the due reverence of a sacred vow i here engage my words .\\ndo not rise yet .\\nwitness , you ever-burning lights above , you elements that clip us round about , witness that here iago doth give up the execution of his wit , hands , heart , to wronged othello\\'s service .\\nlet him command , and to obey shall be in me remorse , what bloody business ever .\\ni greet thy love not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous , and will upon the instant put thee to \\'t .\\nwithin these three days let me hear thee say that cassio\\'s not alive .\\nbut let her live .\\noh , damn her , damn her !\\ncome , go with me apart .\\ni will withdraw to furnish me with some swift means of death for the fair devil .\\nnow art thou my lieutenant .\\ni am your own for ever .\\npray you lead on .\\nat every house i\\'ll call .\\ni will deserve your pains .\\nwhy , man ?\\ngo to .\\nwhere lodges he ?\\nto tell you where he lodges is to tell you where i lie .\\ncan anything be made of this ?\\ni know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here , or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .\\ncan you inquire him out and be edified by report ?\\nseek him , bid him come hither .\\ntell him i have moved my lord on his behalf , and hope all will be well .\\nto do this is within the compass of man\\'s wit , and therefore i will attempt the doing it .\\nwhere should i lose that handkerchief , emilia ?\\ni know not , madam .\\nbelieve me , i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes .\\nand but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are , it were enough to put him to ill thinking .\\nis he not jealous ?\\nwho , he ?\\ni think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him .\\nlook where he comes .\\ni will not leave him now till cassio be called to him. , how is \\'t with you , my lord ?\\nhot , hot , and moist .\\nthis hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty , fasting , and prayer ,\\nmuch castigation , exercise devout , for here\\'s a young and sweating devil here , that commonly rebels .\\ntis a good hand , a frank one .\\nthe hearts of old gave hands , but our new heraldry is hands , not hearts .\\ni can not speak of this .\\ncome now , your promise .\\nwhat promise , chuck ?\\ni have sent to bid cassio come speak with you .\\ni have a salt and sorry rheum offends me .\\nlend me thy handkerchief .\\nhere , my lord .\\nthat which i gave you .\\ni have it not about me .\\nnot ?\\nno , indeed , my lord .\\nthat\\'s a fault .\\nthe thoughts of people .\\nshe told her , while she kept it \\'twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love , but if she lost it or made gift of it , my father\\'s eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies .\\nshe , dying , gave it me and bid me , when my fate would have me wived , to give it her .\\ni did so , and take heed on \\'t , make it a darling like your precious eye .\\nis \\'t possible ?\\ntis true .\\nthere\\'s magic in the web of it .\\na sibyl , that had numbered in the world the sun to course two hundred compasses , in her prophetic fury sewed the work .\\nthe worms were hallowed that did breed the silk , and it was dyed in mummy which the skillful conserved of maidens \\' hearts .\\nindeed ?\\nis \\'t true ?\\nmost veritable , therefore look to \\'t well .\\nthen would to heaven that i had never seen \\'t !\\nha !\\nwherefore ?\\nwhy do you speak so startingly and rash ?\\nis \\'t lost ?\\nis \\'t gone ?\\nspeak , is \\'t out o \\' th \\' way ?\\nbless us !\\nsay you ?\\nit is not lost , but what and if it were ?\\nhow !\\ni say , it is not lost .\\npray you , let cassio be received again .\\nfetch me the handkerchief , my mind misgives .\\ncome , come , you\\'ll never meet a more sufficient man .\\nthe handkerchief !\\naway !\\nis not this man jealous ?\\ni ne\\'er saw this before .\\nthey are all but stomachs , and we all but food .\\nto eat us hungerly , and when they are full , they belch us .\\nlook you , cassio and my husband !\\nthere is no other way .\\ntis she must do \\'t , and , lo , the happiness !\\ngo and importune her .\\nso shall i clothe me in a forced content , and shut myself up in some other course , to fortune\\'s alms .\\nmy lord is not my lord , nor should i know him were he in favor as in humor altered .\\nso help me every spirit sanctified as i have spoken for you all my best and stood within the blank of his displeasure for my free speech .\\nyou must awhile be patient .\\nwhat i can do i will , and more i will than for myself i dare .\\nlet that suffice you .\\nis my lord angry ?\\ncan he be angry ?\\nthere\\'s matter in \\'t indeed , if he be angry .\\ni prithee , do so .\\nsomething , sure , of state , either from venice , or some unhatched practice made demonstrable here in cyprus to him , hath puddled his clear spirit , and in such cases men\\'s natures wrangle with inferior things , though great ones are their object .\\ntis even so , for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members even to that sense of pain .\\nnay , we must think men are not gods , nor of them look for such observances as fit the bridal .\\npray heaven it be state matters , as you think , and no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you .\\nalas the day !\\ni never gave him cause .\\nbut jealous souls will not be answered so .\\nthey are not ever jealous for the cause , but jealous for they\\'re jealous .\\nit is a monster begot upon itself , born on itself .\\nheaven keep the monster from othello\\'s mind !\\nlady , amen .\\ni will go seek him. , cassio , walk hereabout .\\nif i do find him fit , i\\'ll move your suit and seek to effect it to my uttermost .\\ni humbly thank your ladyship .\\nsave you , friend cassio !\\nwhat make you from home ?\\nhow is \\'t with you , my most fair bianca ?\\nindeed , sweet love , i was coming to your house .\\nand i was going to your lodging , cassio .\\nwhat , keep a week away ?\\nseven days and nights ?\\neight score eight hours ?\\nand lovers \\' absent hours more tedious than the dial eightscore times !\\noh weary reckoning !\\no cassio , whence came this ?\\nis \\'t come to this ?\\nwell , well .\\ngo to , woman , throw your vile guesses in the devil\\'s teeth from whence you have them .\\nwhy , whose is it ?\\ni like the work well .\\nere it be demanded , as like enough it will , i would have it copied .\\ntake it and do \\'t , and leave me for this time .\\nleave you !\\nwherefore ?\\ni do attend here on the general and think it no addition , nor my wish , to have him see me womaned .\\nwhy , i pray you ?\\nnot that i love you not .\\nbut that you do not love me .\\ni pray you bring me on the way a little and say if i shall see you soon at night .\\ntis but a little way that i can bring you , for i attend here .\\nbut i\\'ll see you soon .\\ntis very good .\\ni must be circumstanced .\\nnine or ten times i had thought t \\' have yerked him here under the ribs .\\ntis better as it is .\\nnay , but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that , with the little godliness i have , i did full hard forbear him .\\nlet him do his spite .\\nmy services which i have done the signiory shall out-tongue his complaints .\\nwill you think so ?\\nthink so , iago ?\\nwhat , to kiss in private ?\\nan unauthorized kiss !\\nor to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more , not meaning any harm ?\\nnaked in bed , iago , and not mean harm !\\nit is hypocrisy against the devil .\\nso they do nothing , \\'tis a venial slip .\\nbut if i give my wife a handkerchief , what then ?\\nshe is protectress of her honor too .\\nmay she give that ?\\nbut for the handkerchief , by heaven , i would most gladly have forgot it .\\nthou saidst , oh , it comes o\\'er my memory , as doth the raven o\\'er the infectious house , boding to all , he had my handkerchief .\\nay , what of that ?\\nthat\\'s not so good now .\\nwhat if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?\\nhe hath , my lord , but be you well assured no more than he\\'ll unswear .\\nwhat hath he said ?\\nwhy , that he did , i know not what he did .\\nlie , with her ?\\nwith her , on her , what you will .\\nlie with her ?\\nlie on her ?\\nlie with her , that\\'s fulsome .\\nhandkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !\\nnoses , ears , and lips .\\nis \\'t possible ?\\nconfess ! , handkerchief ! , oh , devil ! , work on , my medicine , work !\\nhow now , cassio !\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nthis is his second fit .\\nhe had one yesterday .\\nrub him about the temples .\\nno , forbear .\\nif not , he foams at mouth and by and by breaks out to savage madness .\\nlook , he stirs .\\ndo you withdraw yourself a little while ,\\nwhen he is gone i would on great occasion speak with you .\\nhow is it , general ?\\nhave you not hurt your head ?\\ndost thou mock me ?\\nwould you would bear your fortune like a man !\\na horned man\\'s a monster and a beast .\\ndid he confess it ?\\ngood sir , be a man , think every bearded fellow that\\'s but yoked may draw with you .\\nyour case is better .\\nno , let me know , and knowing what i am , i know what she shall be .\\noh , thou art wise !\\ntis certain .\\nwhilst you were here o\\'erwhelmed with your grief , a passion most resulting such a man , cassio came hither .\\ni shifted him away and laid good \\'scuses upon your ecstasy ,\\nbade him anon return and here speak with me , the which he promised .\\nfor i will make him tell the tale anew where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when he hath , and is again to cope your wife .\\ni say , but mark his gesture .\\nmarry , patience , or i shall say you are all in all in spleen , and nothing of a man .\\ndost thou hear , iago ?\\nwill you withdraw ?\\nnow will i question cassio of bianca , a huswife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes .\\nit is a creature that dotes on cassio , as \\'tis the strumpet\\'s plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one .\\nhe , when he hears of her , can not refrain from the excess of laughter .\\nas he shall smile , othello shall go mad .\\nand his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio\\'s smiles , gestures , and light behavior quite in the wrong. , how do you now , lieutenant ?\\nalas , poor caitiff !\\nlook how he laughs already !\\ni never knew woman love man so .\\nalas , poor rogue , i think indeed she loves me .\\nnow he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .\\ndo you hear , cassio ?\\nnow he importunes him to tell it o\\'er .\\ngo to , well said , well said .\\nshe gives it out that you shall marry her .\\ndo you intend it ?\\nha , ha , ha !\\ndo you triumph ?\\ni marry her !\\nwhat ?\\nprithee bear some charity to my wit .\\ndo not think it so unwholesome .\\nha , ha , ha !\\nso , so , so , so !\\nprithee say true !\\nwell .\\nshe is persuaded i will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .\\niago beckons me .\\nnow he begins the story .\\nshe was here even now .\\nshe haunts me in every place .\\ni was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain venetians , and thither comes the bauble and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck , crying \"o dear cassio ! \" as it were .\\nha , ha , ha !\\nnow he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .\\nlook , where she comes .\\ntis such another fitchew .\\nwhat did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ?\\ni was a fine fool to take it .\\ni must take out the work ?\\na likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there !\\nthis is some minx\\'s token , and i must take out the work ?\\nhow now , my sweet bianca !\\nhow now , how now ?\\nby heaven , that should be my handkerchief !\\nif you\\'ll come to supper tonight , you may .\\nif you will not , come when you are next prepared for .\\nafter her , after her .\\ni must , she\\'ll rail in the street else .\\nwill you sup there ?\\nyes , i intend so .\\ndid you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?\\no iago !\\nand did you see the handkerchief ?\\nwas that mine ?\\nyours by this hand .\\nand to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife !\\nshe gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .\\ni would have him nine years a-killing .\\na fine woman !\\na fair woman !\\na sweet woman !\\nnay , you must forget that .\\nay , let her rot and perish and be damned tonight , for she shall not live .\\noh , the world hath not a sweeter creature , she might lie by an emperor\\'s side and command him tasks .\\nnay , that\\'s not your way .\\nso delicate with her needle , an admirable musician .\\noh , she will sing the savageness out of a bear !\\nof so high and plenteous wit and invention !\\nshe\\'s the worse for all this .\\noh , a thousand thousand times , and then of so gentle a

unprovide my mind again , this night , iago !\\ndo it not with poison .\\nstrangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .\\ngood , good , the justice of it pleases !\\nvery good !\\nand for cassio , let me be his undertaker .\\nyou shall hear more by midnight .\\nexcellent good .\\nthose are the raised father and his friends .\\nyou were best go in .\\nnot i , i must be found .\\nmy

for a special purpose which wrought to his desire .\\nyour power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus .\\nfor this slave , if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long , it shall be his .\\nyou shall close prisoner rest till that the nature of your fault be known to the venetian state. , come , bring him away .\\nnothing extenuate , nor set down aught in malice .\\nthen must you speak of one that loved not wisely , but too well .\\nof one not easily jealous , but being wrought , perplexed in the extreme .\\nof one whose hand , like the base indian , threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe .\\nset you down this ,\\nand say besides that in aleppo once , where a malignant and a turbaned turk beat a venetian and traduced the state , i took by the throat the circumcised dog , and smote him , thus .\\noh , bloody period !\\nall that is spoke is marred .\\nthis did i fear , but thought he had no weapon , for he was great of heart .\\nhow say you by this change ?\\nthis can not be , by no assay of reason .\\ntis a pageant , to keep us in false gaze .\\nhere is more news .\\nay , so i thought .\\nhow many , as you guess ?\\nof thirty sail .\\nand now they do re-stem their backward course , bearing with frank appearance their purposes toward cyprus .\\nsignior montano , your trusty and most valiant servitor , with his free

than pertains to feats of broils and battle , and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself .\\na maiden never bold , of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself .\\nagainst all rules of nature , and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be .\\ni therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful o\\'er the blood or with some dram , conjured to this effect , he wrought upon her .\\nbut , othello , speak .\\nor came it by request and such fair question as soul to soul affordeth ?\\nand let her speak of me before her father .\\nfetch desdemona hither .\\nyou best know the place .\\nand till she come , as truly as to heaven i do confess the vices of my blood so justly to your grave ears i\\'ll present how i did thrive in this fair lady\\'s love and she in mine .\\nsay it , othello .\\nher father loved me , oft invited me , still questioned me the story of my life from year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes , that i have passed .\\nthese things to hear would desdemona seriously incline .\\nshe wished she had not heard it , yet she wished that heaven had made her such a man .\\nshe thanked me and bade me , if i had a friend that loved her , i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her .\\nupon this hint i spake .\\nshe loved me for the dangers i had passed , and i loved her that she did pity them .\\nthis only is the witchcraft i have used .\\nhere comes the lady .\\nlet her witness it .\\ni think this tale would win my daughter too .\\ni pray you , hear her speak .\\nif she confess that she was half the wooer , destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man. , come hither , gentle mistress .\\ndo you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience ?\\nmy noble father , i do perceive here a divided duty .\\nto you i am bound for life and education .\\nyou are the lord of duty .\\ni am hitherto your daughter .\\ni have done

and such things else of quality and respect as doth import you .\\nto his conveyance i assign my wife , with what else needful your good grace shall think to be sent after me .\\nwherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he .\\nmere prattle without practice is all his soldiership .\\nwhy , there\\'s no remedy .\\ntis the curse of service .\\nnow sir , be judge yourself , whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor .\\ni would not follow him then .\\no sir , content you .\\ni follow him to serve my turn upon him .\\nwe can not all be masters , nor all masters can not be truly followed .\\nyou shall mark many a duteous and knee-crooking knave that ( doting on his own obsequious bondage ) wears out his time much like his master\\'s ass for naught but provender , and when he\\'s old , cashiered .\\nwhip me such honest knaves .\\nthese fellows have some soul ,\\nlet it be so .\\nuse desdemona well .\\nlook to her , moor , if thou hast eyes to see .\\nshe has deceived her father , and may thee .\\nmy life upon her faith ! , honest iago , my desdemona must i leave to thee .\\ni prithee , let thy wife attend on her , and bring them after in the best advantage .\\ncome , desdemona , i have but an hour of love , of worldly matter and direction , to spend with thee .\\nwe must obey the time .\\niago .\\nwhat say\\'st thou , noble heart ?\\nwhat will i do , think\\'st thou ?\\nwhy , go to bed , and sleep .\\ni will incontinently drown myself .\\nif thou dost i shall never love thee after .\\nwhy , thou silly gentleman !\\noh , villainous !\\ni have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself .\\nere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen , i would change my humanity with a baboon .\\nwhat should i do ?\\ni confess it is my shame to be so fond , but it is not in my virtue to amend it .\\nvirtue ?\\na fig !\\ntis in ourselves that we are thus or thus .\\nour bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners .\\nso that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and weed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many , either to have it sterile with idleness , or manured with industry , why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills .\\nif the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost\\'rous conclusions .\\nbut we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts .\\nit can not be .\\nit is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will .\\ncome , be a man .\\ndrown thyself ?\\ndrown cats and blind puppies !\\ni have professed me thy friend , and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness .\\ni could never better stead thee than now .\\nput money in thy purse .\\nthese moors are changeable in their wills , fill thy purse with money .\\nthe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida .\\nshe must change for youth .\\ntherefore , put money in thy purse .\\nif thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning .\\nmake all the money thou canst .\\nif sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her .\\na pox of drowning thyself !\\ntis clean out of the way .\\nthou art sure of me .\\ngo , make money .\\ni have told thee often , and i re-tell thee again and again , i hate the moor .\\nlet us be conjunctive in our revenge against him .\\ntraverse , go , provide thy money .\\nwe will have more of this tomorrow .\\nadieu .\\nwhere shall we meet i \\' th \\' morning ?\\nat my lodging .\\ni\\'ll be with thee betimes .\\nno more of drowning , do you hear ?\\ni am changed .\\ngo to , farewell .\\nput money enough in your purse .\\ni\\'ll sell all my land .\\nthus do i ever make my fool my purse .\\nfor i mine own gained knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit .\\ni hate the moor , and it is thought abroad that \\'twixt my sheets he\\'s done my office .\\ni know not if \\'t be true , but i , for mere suspicion in that kind , will do as if for surety .\\nhe holds me well .\\ncassio\\'s a proper man .\\nlet me see now ,\\nto get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery .\\nhow ?\\nhow ?\\nlet\\'s see .\\ni have \\'t .\\nwhat from the cape can you discern at sea ?\\nnothing at all .\\nit is a high-wrought flood .\\nmethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land , a fuller blast ne\\'er shook our battlements .\\nwhat shall we hear of this ?\\na segregation of the turkish fleet .\\nfor do but stand upon the foaming shore , the chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds , the wind-shaked surge , with high and monstrous mane , seems to cast water on the burning bear , and quench the guards of th \\' ever-fixed pole .\\ni never did like molestation view on the enchafed flood .\\nif that the turkish fleet be not ensheltered and embayed , they are drowned .\\nit is impossible they bear it out .\\nnews , lads , our wars are done !\\nthe desperate tempest hath so banged the turks , that their designment halts .\\na noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet .\\nhow ?\\nis this true ?\\nmichael cassio , lieutenant to the warlike moor othello , is come on shore .\\nthe moor himself at sea and is in full commission here for cyprus .\\ni am glad on \\'t .\\ntis a worthy governor .\\nfor they were parted with foul and violent tempest .\\npray heavens he be , for i have served him , and the man commands like a full soldier .\\ncome , let\\'s do so .\\nfor every minute is expectancy of more arrivance .\\nthanks , you the valiant of this warlike isle that so approve the moor .\\noh , let the heavens give him defense against the elements , for i have lost him on a dangerous sea .\\nis he well

.\\ni am not what i am .\\ndo , with like timorous accent and dire yell as when , by night and negligence , the fire is spied in populous cities .\\nwhat , ho , brabantio !\\nsignior brabantio , ho

little cause to say so .\\ncome on , come on .\\nyou are pictures out of door , bells in your parlors , wild-cats in your kitchens , saints in your injuries , devils being offended , players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .\\noh , fie upon thee , slanderer !\\nnay , it is true , or else i am a turk .\\nyou rise to play and go to bed to work .\\nno , let me not .\\nwhat wouldst thou write of me , if thou should\\'st praise me ?\\no gentle lady , do not put me to \\'t , for i am nothing , if not critical .\\ncome on , assay .\\nay , madam .\\ni am not merry , but i do beguile

and worse !\\nhow if fair and foolish ?\\noh , heavy ignorance !\\nthou praisest the worst best .\\nbut what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?\\nshe that was ever fair and never proud , had tongue at will and yet was never loud , never lacked gold and yet went never gay , fled from her wish and yet said \"now i may , \" she that being angered , her revenge being nigh , bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly , she that in wisdom never was so frail to change the cod\\'s head for the salmon\\'s tail , she that could think and ne\\'er disclose her mind , see suitors following and not look behind , she was a wight , if ever such wights were , to do what ?\\nto suckle fools and chronicle small beer .\\noh , most lame and impotent conclusion !\\ndo not learn of him , emilia , though he be thy husband .\\nhow say you , cassio ?\\nis he not a most profane and liberal counselor ?\\nhe speaks home , madam .\\nyou may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .\\ni know his trumpet .\\ntis truly so .\\nlet\\'s meet him and receive him .\\nlo , where he comes !\\noh my fair warrior !\\nmy dear othello !\\nit gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me .\\noh , my soul\\'s joy !\\nif it were now to die , \\'twere now to be most happy , for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate .\\nthe heavens forbid but that our loves and comforts should increase , even as our days do grow .\\namen to that , sweet powers !\\ni can not speak enough of this content .\\nit stops me here , it is too much of joy .\\ncome , let us to the castle .\\nnews , friends !\\nour wars are done , the turks are drowned .\\nhow does my old acquaintance of this isle ? , honey , you shall be well desired in cyprus , i have found great love amongst them .\\nbring thou the master to the citadel .\\nhe is a good one , and his worthiness does challenge much respect. , come , desdemona , once more , well met at cyprus .\\ndo thou meet me presently at the harbor. , come hither .\\nthe lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard .\\nfirst , i must tell thee this : desdemona is directly in love with him .\\nwith him ?\\nwhy , \\'tis not possible .\\nlay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed .\\nall which the moor is defective in .\\nnow sir , this granted , as it is a most pregnant and unforced position , who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does ?\\nbesides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after .\\ni can not believe that in her .\\nshe\\'s full of most blessed condition .\\nthe wine she drinks is made of grapes .\\nif she had been blessed , she would never have loved the moor .\\nblessed pudding !\\ndidst not mark that ?\\nthey met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together .\\npish !\\nbut , sir , be you ruled by me .\\ni have brought you from venice .\\nwatch you tonight for the command , i\\'ll lay \\'t upon you .\\ncassio knows you not .\\ni\\'ll not be far from you .\\ndo you find some occasion to anger cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline , or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favorably minister .\\nwell .\\nsir , he\\'s rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you .\\nprovoke him that he may .\\nfor even out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of cassio .\\ni will do this , if you can bring it to any opportunity .\\ni warrant thee .\\nmeet me by and by at the citadel .\\ni must fetch his necessaries ashore .\\nfarewell .\\nadieu .\\nthe thought whereof doth , like a poisonous mineral , gnaw my inwards , and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him , wife for wife .\\nor , failing so , yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment can not cure .\\nfor besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial .\\nso much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .\\nall offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told

, wherefore ask you this ?\\nzounds , sir , you\\'re robbed !\\nfor shame , put on your gown .\\nyour heart is burst , you have lost half your soul .\\neven now , now , very now , an old black ram is tupping your white ewe .\\narise , arise , awake the snorting citizens with the bell or else the devil will make a grandsire of you .\\narise , i say !\\nwhat , have you lost your wits ?\\nmost reverend signior , do you know my voice ?\\nnot i .\\nwhat are you ?\\nmy name is roderigo .\\ni have charged thee not to haunt about my doors .\\nin honest plainness thou hast heard me say my

is it not an alarum to love ?\\nshe is indeed perfection .\\nwell , happiness to their sheets !\\nnot tonight , good iago .\\ni have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking .\\ni could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .\\noh , they are our friends .\\nbut one cup .\\ni\\'ll drink for you .\\ni have drunk but one cup tonight , and that was craftily qualified too , and behold what innovation it makes here .\\nwhat , man , \\'tis a night of revels !\\nthe gallants desire it .\\nwhere are they ?\\nhere at the door .\\ni pray you call them in .\\ni\\'ll do \\'t , but it dislikes me .\\nif i can fasten but one cup upon him , with that which he hath drunk tonight already , he\\'ll be as full of quarrel and offense as my young mistress \\' dog .\\nnow \\'mongst this flock of drunkards am i to put our cassio in some action that may offend the isle .\\nbut here they come .\\nif consequence do but approve my dream my boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .\\nfore heaven , they have given me a rouse already .\\ngood faith , a little one , not past a pint , as i am a soldier .\\nsome wine , ho !\\nfore heaven , an excellent song .\\ni learned it in england where indeed they are most potent in potting .\\nyour dane , your german , and your swag-bellied hollander , drink , ho ! , are nothing to your english .\\nis your englishman so expert in his drinking ?\\nwhy , he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your almain .\\nto the health of our general !\\ni am for it , lieutenant , and i\\'ll do you justice .\\noh , sweet england !\\nwhy , this is a more exquisite song than the other .\\nwill you hear \\'t again ?\\nno , for i hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things .\\nwell ,

well enough .\\nexcellent well !\\nwhy , very well then .\\nyou must not think then that i am drunk .\\ntis pity of him .\\nbut is he often thus ?\\ntis evermore the prologue to his sleep .\\nhe\\'ll watch the horologe a double set if drink rock not his cradle .\\nit were well the general were put in mind of it .\\nis not this true ?\\nand \\'tis great pity that the noble moor should hazard such a place as his own second with one of an ingraft infirmity .\\nit were an honest action to say so to the moor .\\nwhy , so .\\nnow have i done a good day\\'s work .\\nyou peers , continue this united

this royal presence ?\\nwho knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?\\nwho knows not he is dead !\\nwho knows he is ?\\nall-seeing heaven , what a world is this !\\nlook i so pale , lord dorset , as

imprisonment ?\\nmy brother killed no man ; his fault was thought , and yet his punishment was bitter death .\\nwho sued to me for him ?\\nthis is the fruits of rashness .\\nmarked you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen looked pale when they did hear of clarence \\' death ?\\no , they did urge it still unto the king .\\ngod will revenge it .\\ncome , lords , will you go to comfort edward with our company ?\\nwe wait upon your grace .\\ngood grandam , tell us , is our father dead ?\\nno , boy .\\nmy pretty cousins , you mistake me both .\\nthen , you conclude , my grandam , he

, what noise is this ?\\ni\\'ll join with black despair against my soul and to myself become an enemy .\\nwhy grow the branches when the root is gone ?\\nwhy wither not the leaves that want their sap ?\\nif you will live , lament .\\nif die , be brief , that our swift-winged souls may catch the king\\'s , or , like obedient subjects , follow him to his new kingdom of ne\\'er-changing night .\\no , what cause have i , thine being but a moiety of my moan , to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries !\\nall springs reduce their currents to mine eyes , that i , being governed by the watery moon , may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world .\\nah , for my husband , for my dear lord edward !\\nah , for our father , for our dear lord clarence !\\nalas for both , both mine , edward and clarence !\\nwhat stay had i but edward ?\\nand he\\'s gone .\\nwhat stay had we but clarence ?\\nand he\\'s gone .\\nand they are gone .\\nwas never widow had so dear a loss .\\nwere never orphans had so dear

.\\nall of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star , but none can help our harms by wailing them. , madam , my mother , i do cry you mercy ; i did not see your grace .\\nhumbly on my

load of moan , now cheer each other in each other\\'s love .\\nthough we have spent our harvest of this king , we are to reap the harvest of his son .\\nthe broken rancor of your high-swoll\\'n hates , but lately splintered , knit , and joined together , must gently be preserved , cherished , and kept .\\nmeseemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london , to be crowned our king .\\nwhy \"with some little train , \" my lord of buckingham ?\\ni hope the king made peace with all of us ; and the compact is firm and true in me .\\nand so in me , and so , i think , in all .\\ntherefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince .\\nand so say i .\\nmy lord , whoever journeys to the prince , for god\\'s sake let not us two at home .\\nfor by the way i\\'ll sort occasion , as index to the story we late talked of , to part the queen\\'s proud kindred from the prince .\\nmy other self , my council\\'s consistory , my oracle , my prophet , my dear cousin , i , as a child , will go by thy direction toward ludlow then , for we\\'ll not stay behind .\\ngood morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?\\ni promise you i scarcely know myself .\\nhear you the news abroad ?\\nyes , that the king is dead .\\nneighbors , god speed .\\ngive you good morrow , sir .\\ndoth this news hold of good king edward\\'s death ?\\nay , sir , it is too true , god help the while .\\nthen , masters , look to see a troublous world .\\nno , no , by god\\'s good grace , his son shall reign .\\nwoe to the land that\\'s governed by a child .\\nin him there is a hope of government , which , in his nonage , council under him , and , in his full and ripened years , himself , no doubt shall then , and till then , govern well .\\nwith patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .\\nmore pity that the eagle should be mewed while kites and buzzards prey at liberty .\\nwhat news abroad ?\\ntis very grievous to be thought upon .\\nwhere is he , in his bed ?\\nhe is .\\ngo you before , and i will follow you .\\nso stood the state when henry the sixth was crowned in paris but at nine months old .\\nstood the state so ?\\nbetter it were they all came by his father , or by the father there were none at all , for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not .\\no , full of danger is the duke of gloucester , and the queen\\'s sons and brothers haught and proud , and were they to be ruled , and not to rule , this sickly land might solace as before .\\ncome , come , we fear the worst .\\nall will be well .\\nuntimely storms make men expect a dearth .\\nall may be well ; but if god sort it so , \\'t is more than we deserve or i expect .\\nbefore the days of change , still is it so .\\nbut leave it all to god .\\nwhither away ?\\nmarry , we were sent for to the justices .\\ntomorrow or next day they will be here .\\ni long with all my heart to see the prince .\\ni hope he is much grown since last i saw him .\\nay , mother , but i would not have it so .\\nwhy , my young cousin ?\\nit is good to grow .\\ngrandam , one night as we did sit at supper , my uncle rivers talked how i did grow more than my brother : \"ay , \" quoth my uncle gloucester , \"small herbs have grace ; great weeds do grow apace.\" and since , methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .\\ngood faith , good faith , the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee !\\nhe was the wretched\\'st thing when he was young , so long a-growing and so leisurely , that if this rule were true , he should be gracious .\\nand so no doubt he is , my gracious madam .\\ni hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt .\\nnow , by my troth , if i had been remembered , i could have given my uncle\\'s grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touched mine .\\nhow , my pretty york ?\\ni prithee let me hear it .\\nmarry , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old .\\ntwas full two years ere i could get a tooth .\\ngrandam , this would have been a biting jest .\\ni prithee , pretty york , who told thee this ?\\ngrandam , his nurse .\\nhis nurse ?\\nwhy , she was dead ere thou wast born .\\nif \\'twere not she , i can not tell who told me .\\na parlous boy !\\ngo to , you are too shrewd .\\ngood madam , be not angry with the child .\\npitchers have ears .\\nhere comes a messenger .\\nwhat news ?\\nsuch news , my lord , as grieves me to report .\\nhow doth the prince ?\\nwell , madam , and in health .\\nwhat is thy news then ?\\nthe mighty dukes , gloucester and buckingham .\\nfor what offence ?\\nthe sum of all i can , i have disclosed .\\nwhy , or for what , the nobles were committed is all unknown to me , my gracious lord .\\nay me !\\ni see the ruin of my house .\\nwelcome , destruction , blood , and massacre .\\nmy husband lost his life to get the crown , and often up and down my sons were tossed for me to joy , and weep , their gain and loss .\\no , preposterous and frantic outrage , end thy damned spleen , or let me die , to look on death no more .\\nthe weary way hath made you melancholy .\\nno , uncle , but our crosses on the way have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy .\\ni want more uncles here to welcome me .\\nthose uncles which you want were dangerous .\\nyour grace attended to their sugared words but looked not on the poison of their hearts .\\ngod keep you from them , and from such false friends .\\ngod keep me from false friends , but they were none .\\nmy lord , the mayor of london comes to greet you .\\ngod bless your grace with health and happy days .\\nfie , what a slug is hastings that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no !\\nand in good time here comes the sweating lord .\\nwelcome , my lord .\\nwhat , will our mother come ?\\non what occasion god he knows , not i , the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary .\\nthe tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace , but by his mother was perforce withheld .\\nnot for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin .\\nweigh it but with the grossness of this age , you break not sanctuary in seizing him .\\nthis prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it and therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it .\\noft have i heard of sanctuary men , but sanctuary children , ne\\'er till now .\\nmy lord , you shall o\\'errule my mind for once. , come on , lord hastings , will you go with me ?\\ni go , my lord .\\ngood lords , make all the speedy haste you may .\\nsay , uncle gloucester , if our brother come , where shall we sojourn till our coronation ?\\nwhere it seems best unto your royal self .\\ni do not like the tower , of any place. , did julius caesar build that place , my lord ?\\nhe did , my gracious lord , begin that place , which , since , succeeding ages have re-edified .\\nis it upon record , or

\\'twere retailed to all posterity , even to the general all-ending day .\\nwhat say you , uncle ?\\ndeath makes no conquest of this conqueror , for now he lives in fame , though not in life .\\nhe can not live , i hope , and must not die till george be packed with post-horse up to heaven .\\nfor then i\\'ll marry warwick\\'s youngest daughter .\\nwhat though i killed her husband and her father ?\\nthe readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father ; the which will i , not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto .\\nbut yet i run before my horse to market .\\nclarence still breathes ; edward still lives and reigns .\\nwhen they are gone , then must i count my gains .\\nwhat , my gracious lord ?\\nrichard of york , how fares our loving brother ?\\nwell , my dread lord , so must i call you now .\\nhow fares our cousin , noble lord of york ?\\ni thank you , gentle uncle .\\no , my lord , you said that idle weeds are fast in growth .\\nthe prince my brother hath outgrown me far .\\nhe hath , my lord .\\nand therefore is he idle ?\\no , my fair cousin , i must not say so .\\nthen is he more beholding to you than i .\\nhe may command me as my sovereign , but you have power in me as in a kinsman .\\ni pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .\\nmy dagger , little cousin ?\\nwith all my heart .\\na beggar , brother ?\\nof my kind uncle , that i know will give , and being but a toy , which is no grief to give .\\na greater gift than that i\\'ll give my cousin .\\na greater gift ?\\no

your grace to wear .\\ni weigh it lightly , were it heavier .\\nhow ?\\nuncle , your grace knows how to bear with him .\\nyou mean , to bear me , not to bear with me. , uncle , my brother mocks both you and me .\\ni shall not sleep in quiet at the tower .\\nwhy , what should you fear ?\\nmarry , my uncle clarence \\' angry ghost .\\nmy grandam told me he was murdered there .\\ni fear no uncles dead .\\nnor none that live , i hope .\\nan if they live , i hope i need not fear .\\nno doubt , no doubt .\\no , \\'tis a parlous boy , bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable .\\nhe is all the mother\\'s , from the top to toe .\\nwell , let them rest. , come hither , catesby .\\nhe , for his father\\'s sake , so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him .\\nwhat think\\'st thou then of stanley ?\\nwill not he ?\\nhe will do all in all as hastings doth .\\nwell then , no more but this : go , gentle catesby , and , as it were far off , sound thou lord hastings how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the tower to sit about the coronation .\\nif thou dost find him tractable to us , encourage him and show him all our reasons .\\nif he be leaden , icy , cold , unwilling , be thou so too , and so break off the talk , and give us notice of his inclination ; for we tomorrow hold divided councils , wherein thyself shalt highly be employed .\\ncommend me to lord william .\\nmy good lords both , with all the heed i can .\\nshall we hear from you , catesby , ere we sleep ?\\nyou shall , my lord .\\nat crosby place , there shall you find us both .\\nnow , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots ?\\nchop off his head .\\nsomething we will determine .\\nand look when i am king , claim thou of me the earldom of hereford , and all the moveables whereof the king my brother was possessed .\\ni\\'ll claim that promise at your grace\\'s hands .\\nand look to have it yielded with all kindness .\\ncome , let us sup betimes , that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form .\\none from the lord stanley .\\nupon the stroke of four .\\ncan not my lord stanley sleep these tedious nights ?\\nso it appears by that i have to say .\\nfirst , he commends him to your noble self .\\nwhat then ?\\nthen certifies your lordship that this night he dreamt the boar had razed his helm besides , he says there are two councils kept , and that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at th \\' other .\\nhis honor and myself are at the one , and at the other is my good friend catesby , where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence .\\ntell him his fears are shallow , without instance .\\nand for his dreams , i wonder he\\'s so simple to trust the mock\\'ry of unquiet slumbers .\\nto fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase .\\nmany good morrows to my noble lord .\\ngood morrow , catesby .\\nyou are early stirring .\\nwhat news , what news in this our tott\\'ring state ?\\nit is a reeling world indeed , my lord , and i believe will never stand upright till richard wear the garland of the realm .\\nhow \"wear the garland\" ?\\ndost thou mean the crown ?\\nay , my good lord .\\ni\\'ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before i\\'ll see the crown so foul misplaced .\\nbut canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?\\nay , on my life , and hopes to find you forward upon his party for the gain thereof ; and thereupon he sends you this good news , that this same very day your enemies , the kindred of the queen , must die at pomfret .\\nindeed , i am no mourner for that news , because they have been still my adversaries .\\ngod keep your lordship in that gracious mind .\\nwell , catesby , ere a fortnight make me older i\\'ll send some packing that yet think not on \\'t .\\ntis a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , when men are unprepared and look not for it .\\no monstrous , monstrous !\\nand so falls it out with rivers , vaughan , grey ; and so \\'twill do with some men else that think themselves as safe as thou and i , who , as thou know\\'st , are dear to princely richard and to buckingham .\\nthe princes both make high account of you , i know they do , and i have well deserved it .\\nfear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?\\nmy lord , good morrow .\\ngood morrow , catesby. , you may jest on , but , by the holy rood , i do not like these several councils , i .\\nmy lord , i hold my life as dear as you do yours , and never in my days , i do protest , was it so precious to me as \\'tis now .\\nthink you but that i know our state secure , i would be so triumphant as i am ?\\npray god , i say , i prove a needless coward !\\nwhat , shall we toward the tower ?\\nthe day is spent .\\nset down , set down your honorable load , if honor may be shrouded in a hearse , whilst i awhile obsequiously lament th \\' untimely fall of virtuous lancaster .\\nwot you what , my lord ?\\ntoday the lords you talked of are beheaded .\\nthey , for their truth , might better wear their heads than some that have accused them wear their hats .\\nbut come , my lord , let\\'s away .\\ngo on before .\\ni\\'ll talk with this good fellow .\\nhow now , sirrah !\\nhow goes the world with thee ?\\nthe better that your lordship please to ask .\\ni tell thee , man , \\'tis better with me now than when thou met\\'st me last where now we meet .\\nbut now , i tell thee , keep it to thyself , this day those enemies are put to death , and i in better state than e\\'er i was .\\ngod hold it , to your honor\\'s good content !\\nthere , drink that for me .\\ni thank your honor .\\nwell met , my lord .\\ni am glad to see your honor .\\ni thank thee , good sir john , with all my heart .\\ni am in your debt for your last exercise .\\ncome the next sabbath , and i will content you .\\nyour friends at pomfret , they do need the priest ; your honor hath no shriving work in hand .\\ngood faith , and when i met this holy man , the men you talk of came into my mind .\\nwhat , go you toward the tower ?\\ni shall return before your lordship thence .\\nnay , like enough , for i stay dinner there .\\ni\\'ll wait upon your lordship .\\ndispatch .\\nthe limit of your lives is out .\\no pomfret , pomfret !\\no thou bloody prison , fatal and ominous to noble peers !\\nnow margaret\\'s curse is fall\\'n upon our heads , when she exclaimed on hastings , you , and i , for standing by when richard stabbed her son .\\nthen cursed she hastings .\\no , remember , god , to hear her prayer for them , as now for us !\\nand for my sister and her princely sons , be satisfied , dear god , with our true blood , which , as thou know\\'st , unjustly must be spilt .\\nmake haste .\\nthe hour of death is expiate .\\ncome , grey .\\ncome , vaughan .\\nlet us all embrace .\\nin god\\'s name ,

, or i of his , my lord , than you of mine. , lord hastings , you and he are near in love .\\ni thank his grace .\\ni know he loves me well .\\nbut for his purpose in the coronation , i have not sounded him , nor he delivered his gracious pleasure any way therein .\\nbut you , my honorable lords , may name the time , and in the duke\\'s behalf i\\'ll give my voice , which i presume he\\'ll take in gentle part .\\nin happy time here comes the duke himself .\\nmy noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .\\nhad you not come upon your cue , my lord , william lord hastings had pronounced your part , i mean your voice for crowning of the king .\\nthan my lord hastings no man might be bolder .\\ncousin of buckingham , a word with you .\\ni\\'ll go with you .\\nwe have not yet set down this day of triumph .\\nwhere is my lord the duke of gloucester ?\\ni have sent for these strawberries .\\nhis grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning .\\nthere\\'s some conceit or other likes him well when that he bids good morrow with such spirit .\\ni think there\\'s never a man in christendom can lesser hide his love or hate than he , for by his face straight shall you know his heart .\\ni pray god he be not , i say .\\nthen be your eyes the witness of their evil .\\nif they have done this deed , my noble lord , if ?\\nthou protector of this damned strumpet , talk\\'st thou to me of \"ifs\" ?\\nthou art a traitor , off with his head .\\nwoe , woe for england !\\nstanley did dream the boar did raze his helm , and i did scorn it and disdain to fly .\\nthree times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble , and started when he looked upon the tower , as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse .\\no , now i need the priest that spake to me !\\ni now repent i told the pursuivant , as too triumphing , how mine enemies today at pomfret bloodily were butchered , and i myself secure in grace and favor .\\no margaret , margaret , now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings \\' wretched head .\\nmake a short shrift .\\nhe longs to see your head .\\no momentary grace of mortal men , which we more hunt for than the grace of god !\\nwho builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep .\\ncome , come , dispatch .\\ntis bootless to exclaim .\\no bloody richard !\\nmiserable england , i prophesy the fearfull\\'st time to thee that ever wretched age hath looked upon. , come , lead me to the block .\\nbear him my head .\\nthey smile at me that shortly shall be dead .\\nghastly looks are at my service , like enforced smiles , and both are ready in their offices , at any time to grace my stratagems .\\nbut what , is catesby gone ?\\ncatesby , o\\'erlook the walls .\\nif ever he have wife , let her be made more miserable by the death of him than i am made by my poor lord and thee. , come now towards chertsey with your holy load , taken from paul\\'s to be interred there .\\nwhat black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds ?\\nlord mayor , the reason we have sent , look back !\\ndefend thee !\\nhere are enemies .\\ngod and our innocence defend and guard us !\\nbe patient .\\nthey are friends , ratcliffe and lovell .\\nhere is the head of that ignoble traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected hastings .\\nso dear i loved the man that i must weep .\\nso smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue that , his apparent open guilt omitted , i mean his conversation with shore\\'s wife , he lived from all attainder of suspects .\\nhad he done so ?\\nwhat , think you we are turks or infidels ?\\ni never looked for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore .\\nbut , my good lord , your graces \\' words shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak ; and do not doubt , right noble princes both , but i\\'ll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this case .\\nand to that end we wished your lordship here t \\' avoid the censures of the carping world .\\nmoreover , urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust , which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , even where his raging eye or savage heart , without control , lusted to make his prey .\\nnay , for a need , thus far come near my person : tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward , noble york my princely father then had wars in france , and , by true computation of the time , found that the issue was not his begot , which well appeared in his lineaments , being nothing like the noble duke my father .\\nyet touch this sparingly , as \\'twere far off , because , my lord , you know my mother lives .\\nand so , my lord , adieu .\\nif you thrive well , bring them to baynard\\'s castle , where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well-learned bishops .\\ni go ; and towards three or four o\\'clock look for the news that the guildhall affords .\\ngo , lovell , with all speed to doctor shaw .\\nnow will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight , and to give order that no manner of person have any time recourse unto the princes .\\nhere\\'s a good world the while .\\nwho is so gross that can not see this palpable device ?\\nbad is the world , and all will come to naught when such ill dealing must be seen in thought .\\nnow , by the holy mother of our lord , the citizens are mum , say not a word .\\ntouched you the bastardy of edward\\'s children ?\\nno .\\nhis answer was , the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder .\\nwould not they speak ?\\nwill not the mayor then and his brethren come ?\\nthe mayor is here at hand .\\nand look you get a prayer book in your hand and stand between two churchmen , good my lord , for on that ground i\\'ll make a holy descant .\\nand be not easily won to our requests .\\ni go .\\nan if you plead as well for them as i can say \"nay\" to thee for myself , no doubt we bring it to a happy issue .\\ngo , go , up to the leads .\\nthe lord mayor knocks .\\nwelcome , my lord .\\ni think the duke will not be spoke withal .\\nnow , catesby , what says your lord to my request ?\\nhe doth entreat your grace , my noble lord , to visit him tomorrow or next day .\\nreturn , good catesby , to the gracious duke .\\ntell him myself , the mayor , and aldermen , no less importing than our general good , in deep designs , and matters of great moment are come to have some conference with his grace .\\ni\\'ll signify so much unto him straight .\\nah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an edward !\\nhe is not lolling on a lewd love bed , but on his knees at meditation ; not dallying with a brace of courtesans , but meditating with two deep divines ; not sleeping , to engross his idle body , but praying , to enrich his watchful soul .\\nhappy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .\\nbut sure i fear we shall not win him to it .\\nmarry , god defend his grace should say us nay !\\ni fear he will .\\nhere catesby comes again .\\nnow , catesby , what says his grace ?\\nhe wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to come to him , his grace not being warned thereof before .\\nhe fears , my lord , you mean no good to him .\\nsorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him .\\nwhen holy and devout religious men are at their beads , \\'tis much to draw them thence , so sweet is zealous contemplation .\\nsee where his grace stands , \\'tween two clergymen .\\nmy lord , there needs no such apology .\\ni do beseech your grace pardon me , who , earnest in the service of my god , deferred the visitation of my friends .\\ni do suspect i have done some offense that seems disgracious in the city\\'s eye , and that you come to reprehend my ignorance .\\nyou have , my lord .\\nsweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .\\nif thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , behold this pattern of thy butcheries .\\no , gentlemen , see , see dead henry\\'s wounds open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh ! , blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , for \\'tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells .\\no earth , which this blood drink\\'st revenge his death !\\neither heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead , or earth gape open wide and eat him quick , as thou dost swallow up this good king\\'s blood , which his hell-governed arm hath butchered !\\nif not to answer , you might haply think tongue-tied ambition , not replying , yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , which fondly you would here impose on me .\\nfirst , if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth , yet so much is my poverty of spirit , so mighty and so many my defects , that i would rather hide me from my greatness , being a bark to brook no mighty sea , than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered .\\nbut , god be thanked , there is no need of me , and much i need to help you , were there need .\\nthe royal tree hath left us royal fruit , which , mellowed by the stealing hours of time , will well become the seat of majesty , and make , no doubt , us happy by his reign .\\non him i lay what you would lay on me , the right and fortune of his happy stars , which god defend that i should wring from him .\\nfor first was he contract to lady lucy , your mother lives a witness to that vow , and afterward by substitute betrothed to bona , sister to the king of france .\\nthese both put off , a poor petitioner , a care-crazed mother to a many sons , a beauty-waning and distressed widow , even in the afternoon of her best days , made prize and purchase of his wanton eye , seduced the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathed bigamy .\\nrefuse not , mighty lord , this proffered love .\\no , make them joyful .\\ngrant their lawful suit .\\nalas , why would you heap this care on me ?\\ni am unfit for state and majesty .\\ni do beseech you , take it not amiss ; i can not , nor i will not , yield to you .\\nzounds , i\\'ll entreat no more .\\no , do not swear , my lord of buckingham !\\nif you deny them , all the land will rue it .\\nwill you enforce me to a world of cares ?\\ncall them again .\\ni am not made of stones , but penetrable to your kind entreaties , albeit against my conscience and my soul .\\ngod bless your grace !\\nwe see it and will say it .\\nin saying so , you shall but say the truth .\\nthen i salute you with this royal title : long live richard , england\\'s worthy king !\\namen .\\ntomorrow will it please you to be crowned ?\\neven when you please , since you will have it so .\\nwho meets us here ?\\nmy niece plantagenet led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester ?\\nnow , for my life , she\\'s wandering to the tower , on pure heart\\'s love , to greet the tender prince. , daughter , well met .\\nwhither away ?\\nno farther than the tower , and , as i guess , upon the like devotion as yourselves , to gratulate the gentle princes there .\\nkind sister , thanks .\\nwe\\'ll enter all together .\\nand in good time here the lieutenant comes. , master lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , how doth the prince and my young son of york ?\\nright well , dear madam .\\nby your patience , i may not suffer you to visit them .\\nthe king hath strictly charged the contrary .\\nthe king ?\\nwho\\'s that ?\\ni mean , the lord protector .\\nthe lord protect him from that kingly title !\\nhath he set bounds between their love and me ?\\ni am their mother .\\nwho shall bar me from them ?\\ni am their father\\'s mother .\\ni will see them .\\ntheir aunt i am in law , in love their mother .\\nthen bring me to their sights .\\ni\\'ll bear thy blame and take thy office from thee , on my peril .\\nno , madam , no .\\ni may not leave it so .\\ni am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .\\nlet me but meet you ladies one hour hence , and i\\'ll salute your grace of york as mother and reverend looker-on , of two fair queens .\\nah , cut my lace asunder , that my pent heart may have some scope to beat , or else i swoon with this dead-killing news !\\no , unpleasing news !\\nthy mother\\'s name is ominous to children .\\nyou shall have letters from me to my son in your behalf , to meet you on the way .\\nbe not ta\\'en tardy by unwise delay .\\no ill-dispersing wind of misery !\\nand i in all unwillingness will go .\\no , would to god that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains !\\nto feed my humor , wish thyself no harm .\\nno ?\\nwhy ?\\npoor heart , adieu .\\ni pity thy complaining .\\nno more than from my soul i mourn for yours .\\nfarewell , thou

, which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .\\nvillain , thou know\\'st not law of god nor man .\\nno beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .\\nbut i know none , and therefore am no beast .\\nmore wonderful , when angels are so angry .\\nvouchsafe , divine perfection of a woman , of these supposed crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself .\\nvouchsafe , defused infection of a man , of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursed self .\\nfairer than tongue can name thee , let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself .\\nfouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself .\\nby such despair i should accuse myself .\\nmy gracious sovereign .\\ngive me thy hand .\\nthus high , by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated .\\nbut shall we wear these glories for a day , or shall they last and we rejoice in them ?\\nstill live they , and forever let them last .\\nah , buckingham , now do i play the touch , to try if thou be current gold indeed .\\nyoung edward lives ; think now what i would speak .\\nsay on , my loving lord .\\nha !\\ntis so , but edward lives .\\ntrue , noble prince .\\no bitter consequence that edward still should live \"true noble prince\" !\\ncousin , thou wast not wont to be so dull .\\nshall i be plain ?\\nwhat sayest thou now ?\\nyour grace may do your pleasure .\\ntut , tut , thou art all ice ; thy kindness freezes .\\nsay , have i thy consent that they shall die ?\\ngive me some little breath , some pause , dear lord ,

.\\ncome hither , catesby .\\nrumor it abroad that anne my wife is very grievous sick .\\ninquire me out some mean poor gentleman , whom i will marry straight to clarence \\' daughter .\\nlook how

.\\nmy lord , i claim the gift , my due by promise , for which your honor and your faith is pawned , th \\' earldom of hereford and the movables which you promised i shall possess .\\nstanley , look to your wife .\\nif she convey letters to richmond , you shall answer it .\\nwhat says your highness to my just request ?\\ni do remember me , henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king , when richmond was a little peevish boy .\\na king , perhaps , my lord , how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me , i being by , that i should kill him ?\\nmy lord , your promise for the earldom , richmond !\\nwhen last i was at exeter , the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it rougemont , at which name i started , because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond .\\nmy lord , ay , what\\'s o\\'clock ?\\ni am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me .\\nwell , but what\\'s o\\'clock ?\\nupon the stroke of ten .\\nwell , let it strike .\\nwhy let it strike ?\\nbecause that , like a jack , thou keep\\'st the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation .\\ni am not in the giving vein today .\\nwhy then , resolve me whether you will or no .\\nthou troublest me ; i am not in the vein .\\nand is it thus ?\\nrepays he my deep service with such deep contempt ?\\nmade i him king for this ?\\no , let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock , while my fearful head is on !\\nthe tyrannous and bloody act is done , the most arch deed of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of .\\ndighton and forrest , whom i did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery , albeit they were fleshed villains , bloody dogs , melted with tenderness and mild compassion , wept like two children in their deaths \\' sad story .\\ntheir lips were four red roses on a stalk , and in their summer beauty kissed each other .\\nkind tyrrel , am i happy in thy news ?\\nif to have done the

good , and be inheritor of thy desire .\\nfarewell till then .\\ni humbly take my leave .\\nthe son of clarence have i pent up close , his daughter meanly have i matched in marriage , the sons of edward sleep in abraham\\'s bosom , and anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight .\\nnow , for i know the breton richmond aims at young elizabeth , my brother\\'s daughter , and by that knot looks proudly on the crown , to her go i , a jolly thriving wooer .\\nmy lord !\\ngood or bad news , that thou com\\'st in so bluntly ?\\nbad news , my lord .\\nmorton is fled to richmond , and buckingham , backed with the hardy welshmen , is in the field , and still his power increaseth .\\nely with richmond troubles me more near than buckingham and his rash-levied strength .\\nsay that i slew them not .\\nthen say they were not slain .\\nbut dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .\\ni did not kill your husband .\\nwhy then , he is alive .\\nin thy foul throat thou liest .\\nqueen margaret saw thy murd\\'rous falchion smoking in his blood , the which thou once didst bend against her breast , but that thy brothers beat aside the point .\\ni was provoked by her sland\\'rous tongue , that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .\\nthou wast provoked by thy bloody mind , that never dream\\'st on aught but butcheries .\\ndidst thou not kill this king ?\\ni grant you .\\ndost grant me , hedgehog ?\\nthen , god grant me too thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed .\\no , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .\\nthe better for the king of heaven that hath him .\\nhe is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .\\nlet him thank me , that holp to send him thither , for he was fitter for that place than earth .\\nhere in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies .\\na dire induction am i witness to , and will to france , hoping the consequence will prove as bitter , black , and tragical .\\nwithdraw thee , wretched margaret .\\nwho comes here ?\\nah , my poor princes !\\nah , my tender babes , my unblown flowers , new-appearing sweets , if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fixed in doom perpetual , hover about me with your

harm , but thus his simple truth must be abused with silken , sly , insinuating jacks ?\\nto whom in all this presence speaks your grace ?\\nto thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace .\\nwhen have i injured thee ?\\nor any of your faction ?\\na plague upon you all !\\nhis royal grace , whom god preserve better than you would wish , can not be quiet scarce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints .\\nbrother of gloucester , you mistake the matter .\\ni can not tell .\\nthe world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch .\\ncome , come , we know your meaning , brother gloucester .\\nyou envy my advancement , and my friends \\' .\\ngod grant we never may have need of you .\\nmeantime god grants that we have need of you .\\nour brother is imprisoned by your means , myself disgraced , and the nobility held in contempt , while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble .\\nby him that raised me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoyed , i never did incense his majesty against the duke of clarence , but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him .\\nand therefore , since i can not prove a lover to entertain these fair well-spoken days , i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days .\\nplots have i laid , inductions dangerous , by drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate , the one against the other ; and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle , false , and treacherous , this day should clarence closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that \"g\" of edward\\'s heirs the murderer shall be .\\nhis majesty , tend\\'ring my person\\'s safety , hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower .\\nupon what cause ?\\nbecause my name is george .\\nalack , my lord , that fault is none of yours .\\nhe should , for that , commit your godfathers .\\no , belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be new christened in the tower .\\nbut what\\'s the matter , clarence ?\\nmay i know ?\\nwhat may she not ?\\ni wis , your grandam had a worser match .\\nmy lord of gloucester , i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs .\\nby heaven , i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts that oft i have endured .\\ni had rather be a country servant-maid than a great queen with this condition , to be so baited , scorned , and stormed at .\\nsmall joy have i in being england\\'s queen .\\nso should we you , if you should be our king .\\nif i should be ?\\ni had rather be a peddler .\\nhear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out in sharing that which you have pilled from me !\\nwhich of you trembles not that looks on me ?\\nfoul , wrinkled witch , what mak\\'st thou in my sight ?\\nbut repetition of what thou hast marred .\\nthat will i make before i let thee go .\\nwert thou not banished on pain of death ?\\ni was , but i do find more pain in banishment than death can yield me here by my abode .\\nthe sorrow that i have by right is yours , and all the pleasures you usurp are mine .\\no , \\'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe , and the most merciless that e\\'er was heard of !\\ntyrants themselves wept when it was reported .\\nwhat , were you snarling all before i came , ready to catch each other by the throat , and turn you all your hatred now on me ?\\nthyself a queen , for me that was a queen , outlive thy glory , like my wretched self .\\nhave done thy charm , thou hateful , withered hag .\\nand leave out thee ?\\nstay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .\\nthe worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul .\\nrichard !\\nha ?\\ni call thee not .\\ni cry thee mercy , then , for i did think that thou hadst called me all these bitter names .\\nwhy , so i did , but looked for no reply .\\no , let me make the period to my curse !\\ntis done by me , and ends in \"margaret.\" thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .\\npoor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune , why strew\\'st thou sugar on that bottled spider , whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?\\nthe day will come that thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad .\\nfalse-boding woman , end thy frantic curse , lest to thy harm thou move our patience .\\nfoul shame upon you , you have all moved mine .\\nwere you well served , you would be taught your duty .\\nto serve me well , you all should do me duty : teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects .\\no , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !\\nthey that stand high have many blasts to shake them , and if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .\\ngood counsel , marry .\\nlearn it , learn it , marquess .\\nit touches you , my lord , as much as me .\\nand turns the sun to shade .\\nurge neither charity nor shame to me .\\nuncharitably with me have you dealt , and shamefully my hopes by you are butchered .\\nmy charity is outrage , life my shame , and in that shame still live my sorrows \\' rage .\\nhave done , have done .\\nthy garments are not spotted with our blood , nor thou within the compass of my curse .\\nnor no one here , for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air .\\nwhat doth she say , my lord of buckingham ?\\nnothing that i respect , my gracious lord .\\nwhat , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel , and soothe the devil that i warn thee from ?\\nmy hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .\\nand so doth mine .\\ni muse why she\\'s at liberty .\\ni can not blame her .\\ni never did her any , to my knowledge .\\nyet you have all the vantage of her wrong .\\nmarry , as for clarence , he is well repaid ; he is franked up to fatting for his pains .\\ngod pardon them that are the cause thereof .\\nso do i ever for had i cursed now , i had cursed myself .\\nyea , richard , when i know , for i protest as yet i do not .\\nbut , as i can learn , he hearkens after prophecies and dreams , and from the crossrow plucks the letter and says a wizard told him that by \"g\" his issue disinherited should be .\\nand for my name of george begins with it follows in his thought that i am he .\\nwhy , this it is when men are ruled by women .\\ntis not the king that sends you to the tower .\\nmy lady grey his wife , clarence , \\'tis she that tempers him to this extremity .\\nmadam , his majesty doth call for you , , and for your grace , , and yours , my gracious lords .\\nwe wait upon your grace .\\ni do the wrong , and first begin to brawl .\\nnow they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers , dorset , grey ; but then i sigh and , with a piece of scripture , tell them that god bids us do good for evil ; and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stolen out of holy writ , and seem a saint when most i play the devil .\\nbut , soft !\\nare you now going to dispatch this thing ?\\nwe are , my lord , and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is .\\nwell thought upon .\\ni have it here about me .\\ntut , tut , my lord , we will not stand to prate .\\ntalkers are no good doers .\\nbe assured we go to use our hands and not our tongues .\\nyour eyes drop millstones , when fools \\' eyes drop tears .\\ni like you lads .\\ngo , go , dispatch .\\nwe will , my noble lord .\\nwhy looks your grace so heavily today ?\\nwhat was your dream , my lord ?\\ni pray you tell me .\\nmethoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarked to cross to burgundy , and in my company my brother gloucester , who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches .\\nthence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times , during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall\\'n us .\\no lord , methought what pain it was to drown , what dreadful noise of waters in my ears , what sights of ugly death within my eyes .\\nmethoughts i saw a thousand fearful wracks , a thousand men that fishes gnawed upon , wedges of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , all scattered in the bottom of the sea .\\nhad you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?\\nmethought i had , and often did i strive to yield the ghost , but still the envious flood stopped in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty , vast , and wand\\'ring air , but smothered it within my panting bulk , who almost burst to belch it in the sea .\\ni passed , methought , the melancholy flood , with that sour ferryman which poets write of , unto the kingdom of perpetual night .\\nthe first that there did greet my stranger-soul was my great father-in-law , renowned warwick , who spake aloud , \"what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence ? \" and so he vanished .\\nno marvel , lord , though it affrighted you .\\ni am afraid , methinks , to hear you tell it .\\nah keeper , keeper , i have done those things , that now give evidence against my soul , for edward\\'s sake , and see how he requites me. , o god , if my deep prayers can not appease thee , but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , yet execute thy wrath in me alone !\\no , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children ! , keeper , i prithee sit by me awhile .\\nmy soul is heavy , and i fain would sleep .\\ni will , my lord .\\ngod give your grace good rest .\\nsorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , makes the night morning , and the noontide night .\\nprinces have but their titles for their glories , an outward honor for an inward toil ,\\nwhat wouldst thou , fellow ?\\nand how cam\\'st thou hither ?\\ni would speak with clarence , and i came hither on my legs .\\nwhat , so brief ?\\ntis better , sir , to be brief than tedious. , let him see our commission , and talk no more .\\ni am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands .\\nthere lies the duke asleep , and there the keys .\\nyou may , sir .\\ntis a point of wisdom .\\nfare you well .\\nwhat , shall i stab him as he sleeps ?\\nno .\\nhe\\'ll say \\'twas done cowardly , when he wakes .\\nwhy , he shall never wake until the great judgment day .\\nwhy , then he\\'ll say we stabbed him sleeping .\\nthe urging of that word \"judgment\" hath bred a kind of remorse in me .\\nwhat , art thou afraid ?\\nnot to kill him , having a warrant , but to be damned for killing him , from the which no warrant can defend me .\\ni thought thou hadst been resolute .\\nso i am , to let him live .\\ni\\'ll back to the duke of gloucester and tell him so .\\nnay , i prithee stay a little .\\ni hope this passionate humor of mine will change .\\nit was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty .\\nhow dost thou feel thyself now ?\\nfaith , some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .\\nremember our reward when the deed\\'s done .\\nzounds , he dies !\\ni had forgot the reward .\\nwhere\\'s thy conscience now ?\\no , in the duke of gloucester\\'s purse .\\nso when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out .\\ntis no matter .\\nlet it go .\\nthere\\'s few or none will entertain it .\\nwhat if it come to thee again ?\\ni\\'ll not meddle with it .\\ntis a blushing , shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man\\'s bosom .\\ni am strong-framed .\\nhe can not prevail with me .\\nspoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation .\\ncome , shall we fall to work ?\\ntake him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room .\\no excellent device , and make a sop of him .\\nstrike !\\nno , we\\'ll reason with him .\\nwhere art thou , keeper ?\\ngive me a cup of wine .\\nyou shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .\\nin god\\'s name , what art thou ?\\na man , as you are .\\nbut not , as i am , royal .\\nnor you , as we are , loyal .\\nthy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .\\nmy voice is now the king\\'s , my looks mine own .\\nyour eyes do menace me .\\nwhy look you pale ?\\nwho sent you hither ?\\nwherefore do you come ?\\nto , to , to , to murder me ?\\nay , ay .\\nyou scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , and therefore can not have the hearts to do it .\\nwherein , my friends , have i offended you ?\\noffended us you have not , but the king .\\ni shall be reconciled to him again .\\nnever , my lord .\\ntherefore prepare to die .\\nare you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent ?\\nwhat is my offense ?\\nwhere is the evidence that doth accuse me ?\\nwhat lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge ?\\nor who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence \\' death before i be convict by course of law ?\\nto threaten me with death is most unlawful .\\ni charge you , as you hope to have redemption , by christ\\'s dear blood shed for our grievous sins , that you depart , and lay no hands on me .\\nwhat we will do , we do upon command .\\neven so .\\nan please your worship , brakenbury , you may partake of anything we say .\\nwe speak no treason , man .\\nwe say the king is wise and virtuous , and his noble queen well struck in years , fair , and not jealous .\\nhow say you , sir ?\\ncan you deny all this ?\\nwith this , my lord , myself have naught to do .\\nher husband , knave .\\nwouldst thou betray me ?\\ni do beseech your grace to pardon me , and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke .\\nand he that hath commanded is our king .\\nand that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too .\\nwhom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend .\\nhow canst thou urge god\\'s dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in such dear degree ?\\nfor whose sake did i that ill deed ?\\nfor edward , for my brother , for his sake .\\nif god will be avenged for this deed , o , know you yet he doth it publicly !\\ntake not the quarrel from his powerful arm ; he needs no indirect or lawless course to cut off those that have offended him .\\nmy brother\\'s love , the devil , and my rage .\\ni am his brother , and i love him well .\\nyou are deceived .\\nyour brother gloucester hates you .\\no , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear .\\ngo you to him from me .\\nay , so we will .\\ntell him , when that our princely father york blessed his three sons with his victorious arm , he little thought of this divided friendship .\\nbid gloucester think of this , and he will weep .\\nay , millstones , as he lessoned us to weep .\\nright , as snow in harvest .\\ncome , you deceive yourself .\\ntis he that sends us to destroy you here .\\nwhy , so he doth , when he delivers you from this earth\\'s thralldom to the joys of heaven .\\nmake peace with god , for you must die , my lord .\\nhave you that holy feeling in your souls to counsel me to make my peace with god , and art you yet to your own souls so blind that thou will war with god by murd\\'ring me ?\\no sirs , consider : they that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed .\\nrelent , and save your souls .\\nwhich of you , if you were a prince\\'s son being pent from liberty , as i am now , if two such murderers as yourselves came to you , would not entreat for life ?\\nay , you would beg , were you in my distress .\\nrelent ?\\nno .\\ntis cowardly and womanish .\\nlook behind you , my lord .\\ntake that , and that .\\nhow now ?\\nwhat mean\\'st thou , that thou help\\'st me not ?\\nby heavens , the duke shall know how slack you have been .\\ni would he knew that i had saved his brother .\\nso do not i .\\ngo , coward as thou art .\\nwell , i\\'ll go hide the body in some hole till that the duke give order for his burial .\\nand when i have my meed , i will away , for this will out , and then i must not stay .\\nhere comes your father .\\nnever make denial .\\ni must and will have katherine to my wife .\\nnow , signior petruchio , how speed you with my daughter ?\\nhow but well , sir ?\\nwhy , how now , daughter katherine ?\\nin your dumps ?\\ncall you me daughter ?\\nfather , \\'tis thus : yourself and all

, good night our part .\\nbe patient , gentlemen .\\ni choose her for myself .\\nif she and i be pleased , what\\'s that to you ?\\ntis bargained \\'twixt us twain , being alone , that she shall still be curst in company .\\ni tell you , \\'tis incredible to believe how much she loves me .\\no , the kindest kate !\\no , you are novices !\\ntis a world to see , how tame , when men and women are

gold , basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands ; my hangings all of tyrian tapestry , in ivory coffers i have stuffed my crowns , in cypress chests my arras counterpoints , costly apparel , tents , and canopies , fine linen , turkey cushions bossed with pearl , valance of venice gold in needlework , pewter and brass , and all things that belong to house or housekeeping .\\nthen , at my farm i have a hundred milch-kine to the pail , six score fat oxen standing in my stalls , and all things answerable to this portion .\\ntwo thousand ducats by the year of land !\\nnay , i have offered all ,

married .\\ni think \\'twas soto that your honor means .\\ntis very true .\\nthou didst it excellent .\\nthere is a lord will hear you play tonight ; but i am doubtful of your modesties , lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior , for yet his honor never heard a play , you break into some merry passion and so offend him .\\ngo , sirrah , take them to the buttery and give them friendly welcome every one .\\nadieu , good neighbor .\\nsirrah young gamester , your father were a fool to give thee all and in his waning age set foot under thy table .\\ntut , a toy !\\nan old italian fox is not so

.\\nfarewell , sweet masters both .\\ni must be gone .\\nbut i have cause to pry into this pedant .\\nmethinks he looks as though he were in love .\\nno shame but mine .\\nnow must the world point at poor katherine and say , \"lo , there is mad petruchio\\'s wife , if it would please him come and marry her ! \" upon my life , petruchio means but well , whatever fortune stays him from his word : though he be blunt , i know him passing wise ; though he be merry , yet withal he\\'s honest .\\nwould katherine had never seen him , though !\\ngo , girl .\\ni can not blame thee now to weep , for such an injury would vex a very saint , much more a shrew of thy impatient humor .\\nmaster , master !\\nnews , old news , and such news as you never heard of !\\nis it new and old too ?\\nhow may

by saint jamy , i hold you a penny , a horse and a man is more than one and yet not many .\\nyou are welcome , sir .\\nsee this dispatched with all the haste thou canst : anon i\\'ll give thee more

laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant .\\ni\\'ll in to counsel them .\\nwhere is my love ?\\nwhy , sir , you know this is your wedding day .\\ntedious it were to tell and harsh to hear

possible you will away tonight ?\\nmake it no wonder .\\nif you knew my business , you would entreat me rather go than stay .\\nand , honest company , i thank you all , that have beheld me give away

\\'twas burnt and dried away .\\ncome , i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .\\npeter , didst ever see the like ?\\nhe kills her in her own humor .\\nwhere is he ?\\naway , away , for he is coming hither !\\nthus have i politicly begun my reign , and \\'tis my hope to end successfully .\\nmy falcon now is sharp and passing empty , and , till she stoop , she must not be full-gorged , for then she never looks upon her lure .\\nanother way i have to man my haggard , to make her come and know her keeper\\'s call .\\nthat is , to watch her , as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient .\\nshe ate no meat today , nor none shall eat .\\nlast night she slept not , nor tonight she shall not .\\nas with the meat , some undeserved fault i\\'ll find about the making of the bed , and here i\\'ll fling the pillow , there the bolster , this way the coverlet , another way the sheets .\\nand , in conclusion , she shall watch all night , and if she chance to nod i\\'ll rail and brawl , and with the clamor keep her still awake .\\nhe that knows better how to tame a shrew , now let him speak ; \\'tis charity to show .\\nis \\'t possible , friend litio , that mistress bianca doth fancy any other but lucentio ?\\nwhat , master , read you ?\\nfirst resolve me that .\\nand may you prove , sir , master of your art .\\ni tell thee , litio , this is wonderful !\\nmistake

lucentio .\\nkindness in women , not their beauteous looks , shall win my love , and so i take my leave , in resolution as i swore before .\\nwhat , would you make me mad ?\\nam not i christopher sly , old sly\\'s son of burton heath , by birth a peddler , by education a cardmaker , by transmutation a bearherd , and now by present profession a tinker ?\\noh , this is it that makes your servants droop !\\no noble lord , bethink thee of thy birth , call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment , and banish hence these abject lowly dreams .\\nlook how thy servants do attend on thee , each in his office ready at thy beck .\\nwilt thou have music ?\\nhark !\\napollo plays , and twenty caged nightingales do sing : or wilt thou sleep ?\\nwe\\'ll have thee to a couch softer and sweeter than the lustful bed on purpose trimmed up for semiramis .\\nor wilt thou hunt ?\\nnay , i have ta\\'en you napping , gentle love , and have forsworn you with hortensio .\\ntranio , you jest .\\nbut have you both forsworn me ?\\nmistress , we have .\\nthen we are rid of litio .\\ni \\' faith , he\\'ll have a lusty widow now that shall be wooed and wedded in a day .\\ngod give him joy !\\nay , and he\\'ll tame her .\\nhe says so , tranio ?\\nthe taming school ?\\nwhat , is there such a place ?\\nay , mistress , and petruchio is the master , that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long to tame a

have heard it else proclaimed about .\\nalas , sir , it is worse for me than so , for i have bills for money by exchange from florence , and must here deliver them .\\nay , sir , in pisa have i often been , pisa renowned for grave citizens .\\no sir , i do , and will repute you ever the patron of my life and liberty .\\nin all these circumstances i\\'ll instruct you .\\nno , no , forsooth , i dare not for my life .\\nthe more my wrong , the more his spite appears .\\nwhat , did he marry me to famish me ?\\nif not , elsewhere they meet with charity .\\nbut i , who never knew how to entreat , nor never needed that i should entreat , am starved for meat , giddy for lack of sleep , with oaths kept waking and with brawling fed .\\nand that which spites me more than all these wants , he does it under name of perfect love , as who should say , if i should sleep or eat , \\'twere deadly sickness or else present death .\\nwhat say you to a neat\\'s foot ?\\ntis passing good .\\ni prithee let me

patrimony .\\nsir , pardon me in what i have to say .\\nyour plainness and your shortness please me well .\\nright true it is your son lucentio here doth love my daughter and she loveth him , or both dissemble deeply their affections .\\nyour son shall have my daughter with consent .\\nnot in my house , lucentio , for you know pitchers have ears , and i have many servants .\\nbesides , old gremio

?\\nbiondello , what of that ?\\ni pray thee , moralize them .\\nthen thus : baptista is safe , talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son .\\nand what of him ?\\nhis daughter is to be brought by you to the supper .\\nand then ?\\nthe old priest at saint luke\\'s church is at your command at all hours .\\nand what of all this ?\\ni can not tell , except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance .\\ntake you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum .\\nto th \\' church take the priest , clerk , and some sufficient honest witnesses .\\nif this be not that you look for , i have no more to say , but bid bianca farewell forever and a day .\\ni knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit , and so may you , sir .\\nand so adieu , sir .\\nmy master hath appointed me to go to saint luke\\'s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix .\\nshe will be pleased .\\nthen wherefore should

years !\\nby my fay , a goodly nap .\\nbut did i never speak of all that time ?\\no , yes , my lord , but very idle words .\\nwhy , sir , you know no house nor no such maid , nor no such men as you have reckoned up , as stephen sly and old john naps of greece , and peter turph and henry pimpernell , and twenty more such names and men as these , which never were , nor no man ever saw .\\nwhy , how now , kate !\\ni hope thou art not mad .\\nthis is a man , old , wrinkled , faded , withered , and not a maiden , as thou say\\'st he is .\\nfair sir , and you , my merry mistress , that with your

and wander we to see thy honest son , who will of thy arrival be full joyous .\\ni do assure thee , father , so it is .\\nwell , petruchio , this has put me in heart .\\nsoftly and swiftly , sir , for the priest is ready .\\ni fly , biondello .\\nnay , faith , i\\'ll see the church a \\' your back , and then come back to my master\\'s as soon as i can .\\ni marvel cambio comes not all this while .\\nsir , here\\'s the door .\\nthis is lucentio\\'s house .\\nmy father\\'s bears more toward the marketplace .\\nthither must i , and here i leave you , sir .\\nyou shall not choose but drink before

.\\ncome hither , you rogue !\\nwhat , have you forgot me ?\\nforgot you !\\nno , sir .\\ni could not forget you , for i never saw you before in all my life .\\nwhat , my old worshipful old master ?\\nyes , marry , sir .\\nsee where he looks out of the window .\\nis \\'t so , indeed .\\nhelp , help , help !\\nhere\\'s a madman will murder me .\\noh , i am undone , i am undone !\\nwhat , is the

murdered his master !\\no my son , my son !\\ntell me , thou villain , where is my son lucentio ?\\ncarry this mad knave to the jail. , father baptista , i charge you see that he be forthcoming .\\ncarry me to the jail ?\\nhe shall not go to prison .\\ntalk not , signior gremio .\\ni say he shall go to prison .\\ntake heed , signior baptista , lest you be cony-catched in this business .\\ni dare swear this is the right vincentio .\\nnay , i dare not swear it .\\nyes , i know thee to be signior lucentio .\\naway with the dotard !\\nto the jail with him !\\no !\\nwe are spoiled and yonder he is !\\npardon , sweet father .\\nlives my sweet son ?\\npardon , dear father .\\nhow hast thou offended ?\\nwhere is lucentio ?\\nhere\\'s lucentio , right son to the right vincentio , that have by marriage made thy daughter mine while counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne .\\nhere\\'s packing , with a witness , to deceive us all !\\nwhere is that damned villain , tranio , that faced and braved me in this matter so ?\\nwhy , tell me , is not this my cambio ?\\ncambio is changed into lucentio .\\nlove wrought these miracles .\\nbianca\\'s love made me exchange my state with tranio , while he did bear my countenance in the town , and happily i have arrived at the last unto the wished haven of my bliss .\\nwhat tranio did , myself enforced him to .\\nthen pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .\\ni\\'ll slit the villain\\'s nose that would have sent me to the jail .\\nbut do you hear , sir , have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill ?\\nfear not , baptista , we will content you .\\ngo to .\\nmy cake is dough , but i\\'ll in among the rest , out of hope of all but my share of the feast .\\nhusband , let\\'s follow to see the end of this ado .\\nfirst kiss me , kate , and we will .\\nwhat , in the midst of the street ?\\nwhat , art thou ashamed of me ?\\nno , sir , god forbid , but ashamed to kiss .\\nwhy , then let\\'s home again .\\nnay , i will give

by it .\\nhow fares my noble lord ?\\nmarry , i fare well , for here is cheer enough .\\nwhere is my wife ?\\nhere , noble lord .\\nwhat is thy will with her ?\\nare you my wife and will not call me \"husband\" ?\\nmy men should call me \"lord.\" i am your goodman .\\nmy fair bianca , bid my father welcome , while i with selfsame kindness welcome thine .\\nmy banquet is to close our stomachs up , after our great good cheer .\\npray you , sit down , for now we sit to chat as well as eat .\\nnothing but sit and sit , and eat and eat !\\nfor both our sakes , i would that word were true .\\nnow , for my life , hortensio fears his widow .\\nyou are very sensible , and yet you miss my sense : i mean , hortensio is afeard of you .\\nhe that is giddy thinks the world turns round .\\nroundly replied .\\nmistress , how mean you that ?\\nthus i conceive by him .\\nvery well mended .\\nkiss him for that , good widow .\\nhe that is giddy thinks the world turns round\" , i pray you , tell me what you meant by that .\\nyour husband being troubled with a shrew measures my husband\\'s sorrow by his woe .\\nand now you know my meaning .\\na very mean meaning .\\nright , i mean you .\\nto her , widow !\\na hundred marks , my kate does put her down .\\nthat\\'s my office .\\nspoke like an officer !\\nha \\' to thee , lad !\\nhow likes gremio these quick-witted folks ?\\nbelieve me , sir , they butt together well .\\nay , but not frighted me .\\ntherefore i\\'ll sleep again .\\nnay , that you shall not .\\nam i your bird ?\\nshe hath prevented me .\\nhere , signior tranio , this bird you aimed at , though you hit her not. , therefore a health to all that shot and missed .\\na good swift simile , but something currish .\\ntis well , sir , that you hunted for yourself .\\ntranio hits you now .\\ni thank thee for that gird , good tranio .\\nhe has a little galled me , i confess .\\nand , as the jest did glance away from me , \\'t is ten to one it maimed you two outright .\\nnow , in good sadness , son petruchio , i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all .\\nwell , i say no .\\ncontent .\\nwhat\\'s the wager ?\\ntwenty crowns .\\ntwenty crowns ?\\ni\\'ll venture so much of my hawk or hound , but twenty times so much upon my wife .\\na hundred then .\\ncontent .\\na match !\\ntis done .\\nwho shall begin ?\\nthat will i .\\ngo , biondello , bid your mistress come to me .\\ni go .\\nson , i\\'ll be your half bianca comes .\\ni\\'ll have no halves .\\nhow !\\nshe\\'s busy , and she can not come ! \" is that an answer ?\\nay , and a kind one too .\\npray god , sir , your wife send you not a worse .\\ni hope better .\\nnow , where\\'s my wife ?\\nshe says you have some goodly jest in hand .\\nshe will not come .\\nshe bids you come to her .\\nworse and worse .\\ni know her answer .\\nwhat ?\\nshe will not .\\nnow , by my holidam , here comes katherina !\\nwhat is your will , sir , that you send for me ?\\nwhere is your sister , and hortensio\\'s wife ?\\nthey sit conferring by the parlor fire .\\ngo fetch them hither .\\nif they deny to come , swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands .\\nhere is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .\\nand so it is .\\ni wonder what it bodes .\\nmarry , peace it bodes , and love , and quiet life , and awful rule , and right supremacy , and , to be short , what not that\\'s sweet and happy ?\\nnow , fair befall thee , good petruchio !\\nthe wager thou hast won , and i will add unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , another dowry to another daughter , for she is changed as she had never been .\\nsee where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion. , katherine , that cap of yours becomes you not .\\noff with that bauble , throw it underfoot .\\nlord , let me never have a cause to sigh , till i be brought to such a silly pass !\\nfie !\\nwhat a foolish duty call you this ?\\ni would your duty were as foolish too .\\nthe wisdom of your duty , fair bianca , hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime .\\nthe more fool you for laying on my duty .\\nwe will have no telling .\\nshe shall not .\\ni say she shall. , and first begin with her .\\nfie , fie !\\nunknit that threat\\'ning unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor .\\nsuch duty as the subject owes the prince , even such a woman oweth to her husband .\\nand when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , and not obedient to his honest will , what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord ?\\ni am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace ; or seek for rule , supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve , love , and obey .\\nwhy are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unapt to toil and trouble in the world , but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts ?\\ncome , come , you froward and unable worms !\\nmy mind hath been as big as one of yours , my heart as great , my reason haply more , to bandy word for word and frown for frown .\\nbut now i see our lances are but straws , our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , that seeming to be most which we indeed least are .\\ncome on and kiss me , kate .\\ntis a good hearing when children are toward .\\nbut a harsh hearing when women are froward .\\ncome , kate , we\\'ll to bed .\\nwe three are married , but you two are sped .\\ntis a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .\\nmadam wife , they say that i have dreamed and slept above some fifteen year or more .\\nay , and the time seems thirty unto me , being all this time abandoned from your bed .\\ntis much. , servants , leave me and her alone .\\nmadam , undress you and come now to bed .\\nthrice noble lord , let me entreat of you to pardon me yet for a night or two , or if not so , until the sun be set .\\nfor your physicians have expressly charged , in peril to incur your former malady , that i should yet absent me from your bed .\\ni hope this reason stands for my excuse .\\nay , it stands so that i may hardly tarry so long .\\nbut i would be loath to fall into my dreams again .\\nyour honor\\'s players , hearing your amendment , are come to play a pleasant comedy , for so your doctors hold it very meet , seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood , and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy .\\ntherefore they thought it good you hear a play and frame your mind to mirth and merriment , which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life .\\nlet them play it .\\nwhat , household stuff ?\\nit is a kind of history .\\nwell , we\\'ll see \\'t .\\nwe shall ne\\'er be younger .\\npisa , renowned for grave citizens , gave me my being and my father first , a merchant of great traffic through the world , vincentio , come of the bentivolii .\\ni\\'ll pheeze you , in faith .\\na pair of stocks , you rogue !\\ny\\'are a baggage , the slys are no rogues .\\ntherefore you will not pay for the glasses you have burst ?\\nno , not a denier .\\ngo by , saint jeronimy .\\ngo to thy cold bed and warm thee .\\ni know my remedy .\\ni\\'ll not budge an inch , boy .\\nlet him come , and kindly .\\ngramercies , tranio , well dost thou advise .\\nbut stay awhile .\\nwhat company is this ?\\nmaster , some show to welcome us to town .\\ni \\' faith , sir , you shall never need to fear .\\nbut if it were , doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle with a three-legged stool and paint your face and use you like a fool .\\nfrom all such devils , good lord , deliver us !\\nand me too , good lord !\\nmaid\\'s mild behavior and sobriety .\\nsister , content you in my discontent. , sir , to your pleasure humbly i subscribe .\\nmy books and instruments shall be my company , on them to look and practice by myself .\\nhark , tranio !\\nsignior baptista , will you be so strange ?\\nwhy will you mew her up , signior baptista , for this fiend of hell and make her bear the penance of her tongue ?\\nand for i know she taketh most delight in music , instruments , and poetry , schoolmasters will i keep within my house , fit to instruct her youth .\\nand so farewell. , katherina , you may stay , for i have more to commune with bianca .\\nwhy , and i trust i may go too , may i not ?\\nwhat , shall i be appointed hours as though , belike , i knew not what to take and what to leave , ha ?\\nyou may go to the devil\\'s dam !\\nfarewell .\\nthough the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in bianca\\'s love , to labor and effect one thing specially .\\nwhat\\'s that , i pray ?\\nmarry , sir , to get a husband for her sister .\\na husband ?\\na devil !\\ni say a husband .\\ni say a devil .\\nthink\\'st thou , hortensio , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ?\\ntush , gremio .\\nthough it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough .\\ni can not tell .\\nhow say you , signior gremio ?\\ni am agreed , and would i had given him the best horse inv padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , wed her , and bed her , and rid the house of her !\\ncome on .\\ni pray , sir , tell me , is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold ?\\no tranio , till i found it to be true , i never thought it possible or likely .\\naffection is not rated from the heart .\\nif love have touched you , naught remains but so : gramercies , lad , go forward .\\nthis contents .\\nthe rest will comfort , for thy counsel\\'s sound .\\nmaster , you looked so longly on the maid , perhaps you marked not what\\'s the pith of all .\\noh yes , i saw sweet beauty in her face such as the daughter of agenor had , that made great jove to humble him to her hand when with his knees he kissed the cretan strand .\\nsaw you no more ?\\ntranio , i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air .\\nah , tranio , what a cruel father\\'s he !\\nbut art thou not advised , he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ?\\nay , marry , am i , sir ; and now \\'tis plotted !\\ni have it , tranio !\\nmaster , for my hand , both our inventions meet and jump in one .\\ntell me thine first .\\nyou will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching

.\\ni can , petruchio , help thee to a wife with wealth enough , and young and beauteous , brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .\\nher only fault , and that is faults enough , is that she is

where my son lies. , when did you lose your daughter ?\\nin this last tempest .\\ni perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth , their words are natural breath. , but howsoev\\'r you have been justled from your senses , know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan , who most strangely upon this shore where you were wracked , was landed , to be the lord on \\'t .\\nno , my dearest love , i would not for the world .\\nif this prove a vision of the island , one

.\\nthis is as strange a maze as e\\'er men trod , and there is in this business more than nature was ever conduct of .\\nsome oracle must rectify our knowledge .\\nsir , my liege , do not infest your

.\\nand in the morn i\\'ll bring you to your ship and so to naples , where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our dear-beloved solemnized , and thence retire me to my milan , where every third

faint .\\nlet me not , since i have my dukedom got and pardoned the deceiver , dwell in this bare island by your spell , but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands .\\nas you from crimes would pardoned be , let your indulgence set me free .\\ni pray thee , mark me .\\ni , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which , but by being so retired , o\\'erprized all popular rate , in my false brother awaked an evil nature .\\nand my trust , like a good parent , did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was , which had indeed no limit , a confidence sans bound .\\nhence his ambition growing , dost thou hear ?\\nyour tale , sir , would cure deafness .\\nme , poor man , my library was dukedom large enough .\\noh , the heavens !\\nmark his condition and the event .\\nthen tell me if this might be a brother .\\ni should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother .\\nthe king of naples , being an enemy to me inveterate , hearkens my brother\\'s suit , which was that he , in lieu o \\' th \\' premises of homage and i know not how much tribute , should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom , and confer fair milan with all the honors on my brother .\\nalack , for pity !\\ni , not remembering how i cried out then , will cry it o\\'er again .\\nit is a hint that wrings mine eyes to \\'t .\\nhear a little further and then i\\'ll bring thee to the present business which now \\'s upon \\'s , without the which this story were most impertinent .\\nwherefore did they not that hour destroy us ?\\nwell demanded , wench .\\nmy tale provokes that question .\\ndear , they durst not , so dear the love my people bore me , nor set a mark so bloody on the business , but with colors fairer painted their foul ends .\\nalack , what trouble was i then to you !\\noh , a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me .\\nthou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven , when i have decked the sea with drops full salt , under my burthen groaned ; which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue .\\nhow came we ashore ?\\nby providence divine .\\nsome food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan , gonzalo , out of his charity , who being then appointed master of this design , did give us , with rich garments , linens , stuffs , and necessaries , which since have steaded much .\\nso , of his gentleness , knowing i loved my books , he furnished me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom .\\nwould i might but ever see that man !\\nnow i arise .\\nheavens thank you for \\'t !\\nand now , i pray you , sir , for still \\'tis beating in my mind , your reason for raising this sea storm ?\\nknow thus far forth : by accident most strange , bountiful fortune ( now my dear lady ) hath mine enemies brought to this shore .\\nhere cease more questions .\\ntis a good dullness , and give it way .\\ni know thou canst not choose .\\ncome away , servant , come .\\ni am ready now .\\napproach , my ariel , come .\\nall hail , great master !\\ngrave sir , hail !\\nhast thou , spirit , performed to point the

.\\ni pray now , keep below .\\nwhere is the master , boatswain ?\\nnot a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation .\\nall but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , then all afire with me .\\nthe king\\'s son , ferdinand , with hair up-staring , then , like reeds , not hair , was the first man that leaped , cried , \"hell is empty and all the devils are here.\" why , that\\'s my spirit !\\nbut was not this nigh shore ?\\nclose by , my master .\\nbut are they , ariel , safe ?\\nnot a hair perished .\\non their sustaining garments not a blemish , but fresher than before .\\nand , as thou badest me , in troops i have dispersed them \\'bout the isle .\\nthe king\\'s son have i landed by himself , whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle , and sitting , his arms in this sad knot .\\nof the king\\'s ship , the mariners , say how thou hast disposed , and all the rest o \\' th \\' fleet .\\nthe mariners all under hatches stowed , who , with a charm joined to their suffered labor , i have left asleep .\\nand for the rest o \\' th \\' fleet , which i dispersed , they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean float , bound sadly home for naples , supposing that they saw the king\\'s ship wracked and his great person perish .\\nariel , thy charge exactly is performed .\\nbut there\\'s more work .\\nwhat is the time o \\' th \\' day ?\\npast the mid season .\\nat least two glasses .\\nthe time \\'twixt six and now must by us both be spent most preciously .\\nis there more toil ?\\nsince thou dost give me pains , let me remember thee what thou hast promised , which is not yet performed me .\\nhow now ?\\nmoody ?\\nwhat is \\'t thou canst demand ?\\nmy liberty .\\nbefore the time be out ?\\nno more !\\ni prithee , remember i have done thee worthy service , told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served without or grudge or grumblings .\\nthou didst promise to bate me a full year .\\ndost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee ?\\nno .\\nthou dost , and think\\'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep , to run upon the sharp wind of the north , to do me business in the veins o \\' th \\' earth when it is baked with frost .\\ni do not , sir .\\nthou liest , malignant thing !\\nhast thou forgot the foul witch sycorax , who with age and envy was grown into a hoop ?\\nhast thou forgot her ?\\nno , sir .\\nthou hast .\\nwhere was she born ?\\nspeak .\\ntell me .\\nsir , in argier .\\noh , was she so ?\\ni must once in a month recount what thou hast been , which thou forget\\'st .\\nthis damned witch sycorax , for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing , from argier , thou know\\'st , was banished .\\nfor one thing she did they would not take her life .\\nis not this true ?\\nay , sir .\\nthis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child and here was left by th \\' sailors .\\nthou , my slave , as thou report\\'st thyself , wast then her servant .\\nand , for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorred commands , refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage , into a cloven pine , within which rift imprisoned thou didst painfully remain a dozen years ; within which space she died and left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike .\\ndull thing , i say so .\\nhe , that caliban whom now i keep in service .\\nit was mine art , when i arrived and heard thee , that made gape the pine and let thee out .\\ni thank thee , master .\\nif thou more murmur\\'st , i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howled away twelve winters .\\npardon , master .\\ni will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently .\\ndo so , and after two days i will discharge thee .\\nthat\\'s my noble master !\\nwhat shall i do ?\\nsay , what ?\\nwhat shall i

.\\nwidow dido\" said you ?\\nyou make me study of that .\\nshe was of carthage , not of tunis .\\ncarthage ?\\ni assure you , carthage .\\nhis word is more than the miraculous harp .\\nwhat impossible matter will he make easy next ?\\ni think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .\\nand sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .\\nay .\\nwhy , in good time .\\ndown with the topmast !\\nyare , lower , lower !\\nbring her to try wi \\' th \\' main course .\\na plague upon this howling !\\nthey are louder than the weather or our office .\\nyet again ?\\nwhat do you here ?\\nshall we give o\\'er and drown ?\\nhave you a mind to sink ?\\ni\\'ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .\\nlay her a-hold , a-hold !\\nall lost !\\nto prayers , to prayers , all lost !\\nand the rarest that e\\'er came there .\\nbate , i beseech you , widow dido .\\noh , widow dido ?\\nay , widow dido .\\nis not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it ?\\ni mean , in a sort .\\nthat \"sort\" was well fished for .\\nwhen i wore it at your daughter\\'s marriage ?\\nyou cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense .\\nsir , he may live .\\ni not doubt he came alive to land .\\nno , no , he\\'s gone .\\nprithee , peace .\\nyou were kneeled to and importuned otherwise by all of us , and the fair soul herself weighed between loathness and obedience , at which end o \\' th \\' beam should bow .\\nwe have lost your son , i fear , forever .\\nmilan and naples have more widows in them of this business \\' making than we bring men to comfort them .\\nthe fault\\'s your own .\\nso is the dearest o \\' th \\' loss .\\nmy lord sebastian , the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in .\\nyou rub the sore when you should bring the plaster .\\nvery well .\\nand most chirurgeonly .\\nfoul weather ?\\nvery foul .\\nhad i plantation of this isle , my lord , he\\'d sow \\'t with nettle seed .\\nor docks , or mallows .\\nand were the king on \\'t , what would i do ?\\nscape being drunk for want of wine .\\nfor no kind of traffic would i admit .\\nno occupation .\\nno sovereignty , yet he would be king on \\'t .\\nall things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavor .\\nbut nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison , all abundance , to feed my innocent people .\\nno marrying \\'mong his subjects ?\\nnone , man .\\nprithee , no more .\\nthou dost talk nothing to me .\\ntwas you we laughed at .\\nwhat a blow was there given !\\nan it had not fallen flat-long .\\nyou are gentlemen of brave mettle .\\nyou would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .\\nwe would so , and then go a-batfowling .\\nno , i warrant you .\\ngo sleep , and hear us .\\nwhat , all so soon asleep ?\\ni wish mine eyes would with themselves shut up my thoughts .\\nplease you , sir , do not omit the heavy offer of it .\\nit seldom visits sorrow .\\nwe two , my lord , will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety .\\nthank you .\\nwondrous heavy .\\nwhat a strange drowsiness possesses them !\\nit is the quality o \\' th \\' climate .\\nwhy doth it not then our eyelids sink ?\\ni find not myself disposed to sleep .\\nnor i .\\nmy spirits are nimble .\\nthey fell together all , as by consent .\\nth \\' occasion speaks thee , and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head .\\nwhat , art thou waking ?\\ndo you not hear me speak ?\\ni do , and surely it is a sleepy language , and thou speak\\'st out of thy sleep .\\nwhat is it thou didst say ?\\nthou dost snore distinctly .\\nthere\\'s meaning in thy snores .\\ni\\'ll teach you how to flow .\\ndo so .\\noh , if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it !\\nhow , in stripping it , you more invest it !\\nebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth .\\nprithee , say on .\\ni have no hope that he\\'s undrowned .\\noh , out of that \"no hope\" what great hope have you !\\nno hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition can not pierce a wink beyond , but doubt discovery there .\\nwill you grant with me that ferdinand is drowned ?\\nhe\\'s gone .\\nthen , tell me , who\\'s the next heir of naples ?\\nclaribel .\\ntis true , my brother\\'s daughter\\'s queen of tunis , so is she heir of naples , \\'twixt which regions there is some space .\\ni myself could make a chough of as deep chat .\\noh , that you bore the mind that i do , what a sleep were this for your advancement !\\nmethinks i do .\\nand how does your content tender your own good fortune ?\\ni remember you did supplant your brother prospero .\\nmy brother\\'s servants were then my fellows .\\nnow they are my men .\\nbut , for your conscience ?\\nay , sir .\\nbut i feel not this deity in my bosom .\\nshould not upbraid our course .\\nfor all the rest , they\\'ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk .\\nthey\\'ll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour .\\nthy case , dear friend , shall be my precedent .\\nas thou got\\'st milan , i\\'ll come by naples .\\ndraw thy sword .\\none stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest .\\nand i the king shall love thee .\\ndraw together .\\nand when i rear my hand , do you the like , to fall it on gonzalo .\\no , but one word .\\nwhat , must our mouths be cold ?\\nthe king and prince at prayers .\\ni\\'m out of patience .\\nhe\\'ll be hanged yet , though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him .\\nlet\\'s all sink wi \\' th \\' king .\\nlet\\'s take leave of him .\\nthen let us both be sudden .\\nwhy are you drawn ?\\nwherefore this ghastly looking ?\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nwhiles we stood here securing your repose , even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing like bulls , or rather lions .\\ndid \\'t not wake you ?\\nit struck mine ear most terribly .\\ni heard nothing .\\noh , \\'twas a din to fright a monster\\'s ear , to make an earthquake !\\nsure , it was the roar of a whole herd of lions .\\nheard you this , gonzalo ?\\nupon mine honor , sir , i heard a humming , and that a strange one too , which did awake me .\\ni shaked you , sir , and cried .\\nas mine eyes opened , i saw their weapons drawn .\\nthere was a noise , that\\'s verily .\\nlet\\'s draw our weapons .\\nheavens keep him from these beasts !\\nfor he is , sure , i \\' th \\' island .\\nlead away .\\nhis spirits hear me and yet i needs must curse .\\nbut they\\'ll nor pinch , fright me with urchin-shows , pitch me i \\' th \\' mire , nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark out of my way , unless he bid \\'em .\\nsometime am i all wound with adders who with cloven tongues do hiss me into madness .\\nlo , now , lo !\\nperchance he will not mind me .\\nhere\\'s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all .\\nand another storm brewing , i hear it sing i \\' th \\' wind .\\nyond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor .\\na strange fish !\\nwere i in england now , as once i was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver .\\nthere would this monster make a man .\\nany strange beast there makes a man .\\nwhen they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lay out ten to see a dead indian .\\nlegged like a man and his fins like arms !\\nwarm , o \\' my troth .\\ni do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer : this is no fish , but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .\\nalas , the storm is come again !\\nmy best way is to creep under his gaberdine .\\nthere is no other shelter hereabouts .\\nmisery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows .\\ni will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .\\nthis is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man\\'s funeral .\\nwell , here\\'s my comfort .\\ndo not torment me .\\noh !\\nwhat\\'s the matter ?\\nhave we devils here ?\\ndo you put tricks upon \\'s with savages and men of ind , ha ?\\ni have not \\'scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs .\\nthe spirit torments me .\\noh !\\nthis is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got , as i take it , an ague .\\nwhere the devil should he learn our language ?\\ni will give him some relief if it be but for that .\\nif i can recover him and keep him tame and get to naples with him , he\\'s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat\\'s leather .\\ndo not torment me , prithee .\\ni\\'ll bring my wood home faster .\\nhe\\'s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest .\\nhe shall taste of my bottle .\\nif he have never drunk wine afore , it will go near to remove his fit .\\nif i can recover him and keep him tame , i will not take too much for him .\\nhe shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .\\nand the quire , sir , my lord .'"
