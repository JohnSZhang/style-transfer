PRIDE AND PREJUDICE By Jane Austen Chapter 1 It is a universally recognized truth , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in need of a wife .
Although little known about the feelings or opinions of such a man when first entering a neighborhood , this truth is so deeply rooted in the minds of the surrounding families that it is considered the legitimate property of one of them . or the other of their daughters .
" My dear Mr. Bennet , "  said his wife to him one day ,  " have you heard that the Netherfield Park is finally rented ?
Mr. Bennet responded that he did not do it .
" But it is , "  she returned;  " Because Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me everything . " 
Mr. Bennet did not answer .
" Do not you want to know who took it ? " 
cried his wife impatiently .
" You want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . " 
It was an invitation enough .
" But , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of great fortune from the north of England , that he came down on a Monday in a chair and four to see the place , and he was so pleased , that he immediately agreed with Mr. Morris that he was to take possession before Christmas , and that some of his servants would be in the house by the end of next week .  .
" What's her name ? " 
" Bingley . " 
" Is he married or single ? " 
" Oh !
Single , my dear , to be sure !
One man of great fortune; four or five thousand a year .
What a beautiful thing for our girls !
" Comment ?
How can this affect them ?  " 
" My dear sir Bennet , "  replied his wife ,  " how can you be so boring !
You must know that I think of her marriage to one of them .
" It's his idea to settle here ? " 
" Design !
Nonsense , how can you speak that way !
But he is likely to fall in love with one of them , so you must visit him as soon as he arrives .
" I do not see any opportunity for that .
You and the girls can leave , or you can send them by themselves , which may be even better , because as you are as beautiful as any of them , Mr. Bingley can love you the best of Party .  " 
" My dear , you flatter me .
I certainly had my share of beauty , but I do not claim to be extraordinary today .
When a woman has five adult daughters , she has to give up thinking about her own beauty .  " 
" In such cases , a woman does not often have a lot of beauty to think about . " 
" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes to the neighborhood . " 
" It's more than what I am committed to , I assure you . " 
" But consider your girls .
Just think what institution it would be for one of them .
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to leave , simply for that , because in general , you know , they do not visit newcomers .
Indeed , you must leave , because it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not do it .
" You are too scrupulous , surely .
I dare to say that Mr. Bingley will be very happy to see you; and I will send you a few lines to assure him of my full consent to his marriage , whatever he chooses for girls; but I must say a word for my little Lizzy .
" I want you to do no such thing .
Lizzy is not a little better than the others; and I'm sure she's not half as beautiful as Jane , nor half as good-natured as Lydia .
But you always give preference to his heir .
" They have none of them much to recommend , "  he replied; they are all stupid and ignorant like the other girls , but Lizzy has something faster than her sisters .
Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children this way ?
You take pleasure in vexing me .
You have no compassion for my poor nerves .
" You confuse me , my dear .
I have a great respect for your nerves .
These are my old friends .
I have heard you mention them with consideration for at least the last twenty years .
" Ah , you do not know what I'm suffering from . " 
But I hope you will recover and live to see many young men of four thousand come in the neighborhood .
" It will do us no good if some twenty of them come , since you will not visit them . " 
- Count on that , my dear , that when they turn twenty , I will visit them all .
Mr. Bennet was an odd mixture of lively parts , sarcastic humor , reserve and whim , which the twenty-two years' experience had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .
His mind was less difficult to develop .
She was a woman of average understanding , little information and an uncertain character .
When she was unhappy , she thought she was nervous .
The business of his life was to marry his daughters; His consolation was to visit and news .
Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the first to wait for Mr. Bingley .
He had always intended to visit him , although he had always assured his wife that he should not go there; and until the evening of the visit , she had no idea .
It was then disclosed as follows .
Observing his second hat-cutting daughter , he suddenly spoke to her:  " I hope Mr. Bingley will love him , Lizzy .
" We are not able to know what Mr. Bingley likes , "  said his mother resentfully ,  " since we must not visit . " 
" But you forget , mother , "  said Elizabeth ,  " that we will meet him again at the assemblies , and that Madame Long has promised to present it to her . " 
" I do not think Ms . Long will do such a thing .
She has two nieces to her .
She is a selfish and hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion on her .
" I have none left , "  said Mr. Bennet; and I'm glad you do not depend on her to serve you .
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to answer , but , unable to contain herself , she began to scold one of her daughters .
" Do not keep coughing , Kitty , for heaven's sake !
Have a little compassion on my nerves .
You tear them to pieces .  " 
" Kitty has no discretion in her coughing fits , "  said her father;  " She makes them sick . "   " I'm not coughing for my own amusement , "  Kitty replied frantically .
" When is your next ball , Lizzy ? " 
" Tomorrow , fortnight .
Said the mother , and Mrs. Long returns only the day before , so it will be impossible for him to present it , because she will not know it herself .
" Then , my dear , you can have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to her . " 
" Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I do not know him myself , how can you be so teasing ?
" I honor your circumspection .
The knowledge of a fortnight is certainly very small .
We can not know what a man is after a fortnight .
But if we do not venture , someone else will do it; and after all , Ms . Long and her neighbors must have their chance; and , therefore , as she will think it is an act of kindness , if you refuse the post , I will take it upon me .
The girls watched their father .
Mrs. Bennet only said ,  " Nonsense , nonsense ! " 
" What can be the meaning of this emphatic exclamation ? " 
cried he .
" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress imposed on them , as nonsense ?
I can not totally agree with you .
What are you saying , Mary ?
Because you are a young woman of deep reflection , I know , and I read great books and make excerpts .
Mary wanted to say something sensible , but did not know how .
" While Mary adjusts her ideas , "  he continued ,  " let's go back to Mr.
Bingley .  " 
" I'm sick of Mr. Bingley , "  cried his wife .
I'm sorry to hear that , but why did not you tell me before ?
If I had known so much this morning , I certainly would not have appealed to him .
It's very unlucky; but as I have paid the visit , we can not escape the knowledge now .  " 
The astonishment of the ladies was exactly what he wanted; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; however , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that this was what she had been waiting for all the time .
" How good it was in you , my dear M . Bennet !
But I knew that I should finally persuade you .
I was sure you loved your girls too much to neglect such knowledge .
Well , how happy I am !
and it's such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word until now .
" Now , Kitty , you can cough as much as you choose , "  said Mr. Bennet; and as he spoke , he left the room , tired of his wife's raptures .
" What an excellent father you have , girls ! " 
she said , when the door was closed .
I do not know how you will have him repaired for his kindness , nor me for that .
In our time of life , it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to make new acquaintances every day; but for your sake , we would do anything .
Lydia , my love , although you're the youngest , I dare to say that Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball .
" Oh ! " 
said Lydia valiantly ,  " I am not afraid , for although I am the youngest , I am the greatest .
The rest of the evening was spent conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit and determine when they should ask him to dine .
Chapter 3 All that Mrs. Bennet , with the help of her five daughters , could not ask about it , was not enough to draw from her husband a satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley .
They attacked him in various ways - with misguided questions , ingenious assumptions , and distant assumptions; but it escaped them all , and they were finally obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbor , Lady Lucas .
His report was very favorable .
Sir William had been delighted with him .
He was very young , wonderfully handsome , extremely pleasant , and , to top it off , he wanted to be at the next meeting with a big party .
Nothing could be more delicious !
To love dancing was a certain step towards love; and the very bright hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were amused .
" If I can see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , "  said Mrs. Bennet to her husband ,  " and that all the others as well married , I shall have nothing to desire . " 
After a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit and spent ten minutes with him in his library .
He had hoped to be admitted to see the young girls whose beauty he had heard a great deal; but he only saw the father .
The ladies were a little luckier , because they had the advantage of seeing through a superior window that he was wearing a blue coat and riding a black horse .
An invitation to dinner was soon dispatched; and already Mrs. Bennet had planned the courses which were to honor her household , when an answer arrived which postponed all that .
Mr. Bingley was forced to be in town the next day , and therefore unable to accept the honor of their invitation , etc .
Ms . Bennet was rather confused .
She could not imagine what business he might have in town so soon after arriving in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear flying from one place to another , and never to settle in Netherfield as it should have been .
Lady Lucas calmed her fears a little by starting the idea of ​​leaving for London , only to make a big party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .
The girls were afflicted with so many ladies , but they were comforted on the eve of the ball by learning that instead of twelve , he brought only six from London - his five sisters and a cousin .
And when the party entered the meeting room , there were only five people in total - Mr. Bingley , his two sisters , the elder's husband , and another young man .
Mr. Bingley was handsome and gentleman; he had a pleasing physiognomy and easy , unaffected manners .
Her sisters were good women , with an air of decided fashion .
His brother-in-law , Mr. Hurst , merely looked at the gentleman; but his friend M . Darcy soon attracted the attention of the chamber by his handsome and beautiful person , his fine features , his noble countenance , and the report which circulated in general five minutes after his entry , of his ten thousand livres a year .
The gentlemen declared him to be a handsome man , the ladies were much more handsome than Mr. Bingley , and they looked at him with great admiration for about half the evening until his manners were disgusted . which changed the course of things . her popularity; because he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company , and above to be happy; and all his great estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , unpleasant face , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .
Mr. Bingley soon became acquainted with all the principal persons in the room; he was lively and unreserved , danced all the dances , was angry that the ball would close so soon , and spoke of giving one to Netherfield .
Such kind qualities must speak for themselves .
What a contrast between him and his friend !
Mr. Darcy danced once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley , refused to be introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening walking in the room , speaking from time to time . time to one of his own party .
His character was decided .
He was the most proud and unpleasant man in the world , and everyone hoped he would never come back there .
Among the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet , whose aversion to his general behavior was sharpened with particular resentment by the fact that he had despised one of his daughters .
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged , by the dearth of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances; and during part of this period , Mr. Darcy was standing close enough to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley , who had just been dancing for a few minutes , to urge his friend to join him .
" Come , Darcy , "  he said ,  " I must make you dance .
I hate to see you standing on your own in this stupid way .
You danced a lot better .  " 
" I certainly will not do it .
You know how I hate him , unless I'm particularly familiar with my partner .
In such an assembly , it would be unbearable .
Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room that it would not be a punishment for me to get up with it .
" I would not be so tedious as you are , "  cried Mr. Bingley ,  " for a kingdom !
On my honor , I have never met as many pleasant girls in my life as tonight; and there are many of them that you rarely see pretty .  " 
" You are dancing with the only beautiful girl in the room , "  said Mr. Darcy , looking at the eldest Miss Bennet .
" Oh !
She is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen !
But there is one of her sisters sitting right behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very nice .
Let me ask my partner to introduce you .  " 
" What do you mean ? " 
and , looking back , he looked at Elizabeth for a moment , and suddenly he withdrew his , and said coldly: - It is tolerable , but not beautiful enough to tempt me , I am not in the mood to give consequences to Girls . who are despised by other men .
You better go back to your partner and enjoy his smiles , because you're wasting time with me .
Mr. Bingley followed his advice .
Mr. Darcy is gone; and Elizabeth remained without very cordial feelings towards him .
She told the story , however , with a great spirit among her friends; for she had a cheerful and playful disposition which pleased all that was ridiculous .
The evening went quite nicely to the whole family .
Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter admired by Netherfield's party .
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by her sisters .
Jane was as satisfied with this as her mother could be , albeit in a calmer way .
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure .
Mary had heard from Miss Bingley that she was the most accomplished girl in the neighborhood; and Catherine and Lydia had the good fortune to never be without partners , which was all they had learned to nurse at the ball .
They returned in good humor to Longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants .
They found Mr. Bennet still standing .
With a book , he was independent of time; and on this occasion he had much curiosity about the event of an evening which had raised such brilliant hopes .
He had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon discovered that he had a different story to hear .
" Oh !
my dear Mr. Bennet ,  " as she entered the room , "  we had a very pleasant evening , a very good ball .
I wish you were here .
Jane was so admired , nothing could be like that .
Everyone said how much she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her very beautiful and danced with her twice !
Just think about that , my dear . he danced with her twice !
and she was the only creature in the room he asked for a second time .
First , he asked Miss Lucas .
I was so annoyed to see him get up with her !
But , however , he did not admire him at all; indeed , no one can , you know it; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she went down the dance .
So he asked who she was , and introduced herself , and asked her the next two .
Then two-thirds he danced with Miss King , and two-quarters with Maria Lucas , and two-fifths with Jane again , and two-sixths with Lizzy , and Bulanger --  "  "  If he had had any what compassion for me ,  " cried her husband impatiently , "  he would not have danced half as much !
For God's sake , do not say anymore of his partners .
Oh he sprained his ankle during the first dance !
" Oh !
my dear , I am quite delighted with him .
He is so beautiful !
And her sisters are charming women .
I have never seen something more elegant in my life than their dresses .
I dare say the lace on Mrs. Hurst's dress--  " Here she was interrupted again .
Mr. Bennet protested against any description of the adornment .
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness and exaggeration , the shocking grossness of M . Darcy .
" But I can assure you , "  she added ,  " that Lizzy does not lose much by not fitting his imagination , for he is a most disagreeable and horrible man , and not worth the trouble .
So high and so vain that there was not to bear it !
He walked here , and he walked there , thinking himself so great !
Not good enough to dance with !
I wish you were here , darling , for giving him one of your depressions .
I totally hate the man .  " 
Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone , the first , who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before , expressed to her sister how much she admired him .
" He is just what a young man ought to be , "  she said , sensitive , good-natured , lively ,  " and I have never seen such joyous manners , so easy , with such a good breeding !
" It is as beautiful , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " that a young man should be , if he can .
His character is thus complete .  " 
" I was very flattered to have asked me to dance a second time .
I did not expect such a compliment .  " 
" Not you ?
I did it for you .
But it's a big difference between us .
Compliments always take you by surprise , and never follow me .
What's more natural than asking you again ?
He could not help but see that you were about five times prettier than all the other women in the room .
No thanks to his gallantry for that .
Well , he is certainly very nice , and I give you permission to love him .
You liked a lot of stupid people .  " 
" Cher Lizzy ! " 
" Oh !
you know a lot , you know , love people in general .
You never see fault with anyone .
Everyone is good and nice to you .
I never heard you talk about a human being in your life .
I would not hasten to censor anyone , but I always say what I think .
I know you do , and that's what makes you wonder .
With your good sense , be so honestly blind to the follies and absurdities of others !
The assignment of the franchise is quite common - it is everywhere .
But to be candid without ostentation or conception - to take the good of everyone's character and make it even better , and to say nothing about evil - only belongs to you .
And you love that man's sisters too , do not you ?
Their manners are not equal to his .
" Certainly not - at first .
But they are very nice women when you talk to them .
Miss Bingley must live with her brother and keep his house; and I am very much mistaken if we do not find him a very charming neighbor .
Elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced; their behavior at the assembly had not been calculated to please generally; and with more rapidity of observation and less rancor than her sister , and with a judgment too little attentive to herself , she was very reluctant to approve them .
They were actually very beautiful ladies; they were not in a good mood when they were happy , nor able to make themselves agreeable when they chose him , but they were proud and vain .
They were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the city's first private seminars , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were used to spending more than they should , and associating with people from rank , and so were respect to the right to think well of themselves , and maliciously of others .
They were from a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed upon their memories than the fortune of their brother and theirs had been acquired by commerce .
Mr. Bingley inherited the property of nearly one hundred thousand pounds from his father , who intended to buy an estate , but did not live to do so .
Mr. Bingley wanted it the same and sometimes made the choice of his riding; but as he now had a good house and the liberty of a manor , he was doubtful to many who knew best the facility of his character , if he could not spend the rest of his days at Netherfield , and leave the next generation to buy .
His sisters were anxious to have his own estate; but , although it had been established only as a tenant , Miss Bingley was in no position to preside at her table - and Mrs. Hurst , who had married a man more fashionable than fortune , was no less willing to consider his house as his house when it suited him .
Mr. Bingley was not two years old when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House .
He looked at it , and in it for half an hour - was pleased with the situation and the main halls , satisfied with what the owner said in his praise , and took it immediately .
Between him and Darcy there was a very stable friendship , despite great opposition of character .
Bingley was loved by Darcy for the ease , openness , and ductility of his character , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast with his , and with his he never appeared dissatisfied .
With Darcy's esteem , Bingley had the firmest confidence , and from his judgment the highest opinion .
In understanding , Darcy was the superior .
Bingley was not defective at all , but Darcy was smart .
He was at once haughty , reserved , and meticulous , and his manners , although well-mannered , did not invite him .
In this respect , his friend had a lot of advantage .
Bingley was sure to be loved wherever he appeared , Darcy continually offended .
The way they spoke about Meryton's assembly was characteristic enough .
Bingley had never met more pleasant people or prettier girls in her life; everyone had been very kind and attentive to him; there was no formality , no stiffness; he had soon become familiar with the whole room; and as for Miss Bennet , he could not conceive a more beautiful angel .
Darcy , on the other hand , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and fashion , and none of whom had felt the least interest , and where no one had received either attention or pleasure .
Miss Bennet he admitted to being pretty , but she smiled too much .
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed this to be so - but they still admired and loved her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one they would not object to knowing more about .
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt empowered by such a recommendation to think of her as he chose .
Chapter 5 A few steps from Longbourn lived a family with which the Bennets were particularly intimate .
Sir William Lucas had formerly been in commerce at Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and rose to the honor of chivalry by an address to the king during his mayoralty .
The distinction may have been felt too strongly .
This had disgusted him with his business and his residence in a small village; and , leaving them both , he had taken with his family into a house about a mile from Meryton , then called Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , free of his business , only to be civil to everyone .
For though exalted by his rank , he did not render him haughty; on the contrary , he was all the attention to everyone .
Inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at St . James had made him courteous .
Lady Lucas was a very good woman , not too smart to be a neighbor of Mrs. Bennet .
They had several children .
The eldest of them , a wise and intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven years old , was Elizabeth's close friend .
That Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to speak of a bullet was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the meeting brought the first to Longbourn to hear and communicate .
" You have started the evening well , Charlotte , "  said Mrs. Bennet with the civilian self-command to Miss Lucas .
" You were Mr. Bingley's first choice . " 
" Yes , but he seemed to like his second best . " 
" Oh !
you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced twice with her .
To be sure that did seems like he's admiring it - actually , I think he's did -- I've heard something about it - but I hardly know what - something about Mr.
Robinson .  " 
" Maybe you mean what I heard between him and Mr. Robinson , I did not tell you ?
Mr. Robinson asks him how he loved our Meryton meetings , and if he did not think there were many pretty women in the room , and he thought he was the prettiest ?
and his immediate answer to the last question:  " Oh !
the eldest Miss Bennet , no doubt; there can not be two opinions on this point .  " 
" On my word !
Well , it's very decided indeed - it seems to be the case - but , however , anything can happen to anything , you know .  " 
" My preaching was better than your wishes , Eliza , "  said Charlotte .
" Mr. Darcy does not deserve to be listened to as much as her friend , is not it , poor Eliza , to be just tolerable ?
" I beg you not to put it in Lizzy's head to be offended by his ill-treatment , for he is such an unpleasant man , that it would be quite a misfortune to be loved by him .
Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat by her for half an hour without opening her lips .
" Are you sure , madame , is it not a small mistake ?
dit jane
" I certainly saw Mr. Darcy talk to him . " 
" Aye - because she finally asked him how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help to answer him , but she said he seemed very angry to be talked about . " 
" Miss Bingley told me , "  said Jane ,  " that he never speaks much except among his intimate acquaintances .
With them , he is remarkably pleasant .
" I do not believe a word , my dear .
If he had been so nice , he would have talked to Mrs. Long .
But I can guess how it was; everyone says that he is eaten with pride , and I dare say that he had somehow heard that Mrs. Long is not holding a car , and had come to the ball in a hack chair  .
" It does not bother me that he does not talk to Mrs. Long , "  said Miss Lucas ,  " but I wish he had danced with Eliza .
- Another time , Lizzy , said his mother , I would not dance with him , if I were you .
" I believe , ma'am , I can promise you never to dance with him . " 
" Her pride , "  said Miss Lucas ,  " does not offend me as much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for that .
It is not surprising that such a young man , with his family , his fortune , all in his favor , has a high opinion of himself .
If I can express it , he has a right to be proud .  " 
" That's very true , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " and I could easily forgive her pride , if he had not mortified mine . " 
" Pride , "  observed Mary , who prided herself on the solidity of her reflections ,  " is a very common defect , I believe .
From all that I have read , I am convinced that it is very common; that human nature is particularly predisposed to it , and that very few of us do not have a feeling of self-satisfaction in terms of quality , whether real or imagined .
Vanity and pride are different things , although words are often used as synonyms .
A person can be proud without being vain .
Pride is more tied to our opinion of ourselves , to our vanity to what we would like others to think of us .
" If I was as rich as Mr. Darcy , "  cried a young Lucas , who came with his sisters ,  " I should not worry how proud I am .
I would like to keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine a day .  " 
" So you drink a lot more than you should , "  said Mrs. Bennet;  " and if I had to see you at it , I should remove your bottle directly . " 
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit .
Chapter 6 The ladies of Longbourn soon waited for those of Netherfield .
The visit was promptly returned in due form .
Miss Bennet's pleasant manners developed on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and although the mother was considered unbearable , and the younger sisters are not worth talking about , a desire to know them better was expressed to the two eldest .
By Jane , this attention was received with the greatest pleasure , but Elizabeth has always seen distrust in their treatment of everyone , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not love them; although their kindness to Jane , as she was , had a value as probably derived from the influence of their brother's admiration .
It was usually obvious , when they met , that he admired her and that it was also obvious that Jane was yielding to the preference she had begun to give her from the beginning , and that she was sort of very love . ; but she considered with pleasure that the world in general could not discover it , since Jane united , with great force of feeling , a coolness and a uniform gaiety which kept her from the suspicions of the impertinent .
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas .
" It might be nice , "  Charlotte said ,  " to be able to impose such a case on the public , but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so well guarded .
If a woman hides her affection with the same skill of the object , she may lose the opportunity to fix it; and then it will be a poor consolation to believe the world also in the dark .
There is so much gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not prudent to let it go .
We can all be free - a slight preference is quite natural; but few of us have enough heart to be really in love without encouragement .
In nine out of ten cases , women are better off showing more affection than they think .
Bingley loves your sister , no doubt; but he can never do more than love him , if he does not help him .  " 
" But she helps him as much as his nature allows .
If I can perceive his respect for him , he must be a fool , indeed , not to discover it too .  " 
" Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane's disposition like you do . " 
" But if a woman is biased to a man , and does not try to hide it , he must find out . " 
" Maybe he has to , if he sees enough of her .
But , although Bingley and Jane meet quite often , it's never for several hours together; and , as they always see themselves in great mixed parties , it is impossible for every moment to be used to converse together .
Jane should take advantage of every half hour during which she can command her attention .
When she is sure of himself , there will be more leisure to fall in love as much as she wants .
" Your project is good , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " it's only a question of wanting to be well married , and if I wanted a rich husband or a husband , I would dare to adopt it .
But these are not Jane's feelings; it does not act by design .
For the moment , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own consideration or of her reasonableness .
She only knew him a fortnight .
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at home , and since then has dined with him in company four times .
It's not enough to make him understand his character .  " 
" Not as you represent it .
If she had been content with him , she could only have discovered if he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings were also spent together - and four evenings can do a lot of things .  " 
" Yes , these four nights have allowed them to see that they both like Twenty-One better than trade , but compared to any other main feature , I do not imagine much has been unveiled . " 
" Well , "  said Charlotte ,  " I want Jeanne's success with all my heart , and if tomorrow she married her , I would think she had a chance of happiness as great as if she were studying her character for a day . year .
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of luck .
If the dispositions of the parties are so well known to one another or so similar in advance , they make no progress for their happiness .
They continue to grow up not long afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible the faults of the person with whom you will spend your life .
You make me laugh , Charlotte , but it's not healthy .
You know it's not healthy , and you'll never do it yourself .
Busy with observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to his sister , Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was becoming an object of interest to her friend .
M . Darcy had at first allowed him to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration for the ball; and when they met , he only looked at her for criticism .
But scarcely had he made it clear to his friends and to himself that she had hardly a good face , that he began to realize that she was made extraordinarily intelligent by the beautiful expression of her black eyes .
To this discovery succeeded others as mortifying .
Although he had detected with a critical eye more than one defect of perfect symmetry in his form , he was forced to recognize that his face was light and agreeable; and although he asserted that his manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was taken by their easy game .
From this she was perfectly unconscious; she was for him only the man who did not enjoy himself anywhere , and who had not found her beautiful enough to dance .
He began to wish to know more about her , and as a step towards conversation with herself , attended his conversation with others .
In doing so , she caught his attention .
It was at Sir William Lucas's , where a large part was assembled .
" What does Mr. Darcy mean , "  she said to Charlotte , listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ?
" This is a question that Mr. Darcy can only answer . " 
" But if he does it again , I'll certainly let him know I see what he's talking about .
He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not start being impertinent myself , I will soon be afraid of him .
Approaching them shortly afterward , without appearing to be about to speak , Miss Lucas challenged her friend to speak to her about a subject; which immediately provoked Elizabeth to do so , she turned to him and said:  " Do not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I singularly well expressed myself just now , when I teased Colonel Forster to give us a ball in Meryton ?
" With great energy , but it's still a subject that makes a woman energetic . " 
" You are severe with us . " 
" It will be soon , "  said Miss Lucas .
" I'm going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . " 
" You are a very strange creature through a friend - always want me to play and sing before everyone else !
If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable; but , in fact , I would rather not sit in front of those who must be used to hearing the best performers .
On the persistence of Miss Lucas , however , she added:  " Very well , if necessary , it must be .
And glancing at Mr. Darcy:  " There is an old saying that everyone here knows well: "  Keep your breath to refresh your porridge ,  " and I'll keep mine to inflate my song .
His performance was nice , although by no means capital .
After one or two songs , and before she could respond to the requests of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly followed to the instrument by her sister Mary , who , having been the only one in the family , worked  . difficult for knowledge and achievements , was always looking forward to posting .
Marie had neither genius nor taste; and although vanity had given her its application , she had also given him a pedantic and vain air , which would have injured a degree of excellence superior to that which she had attained .
Elizabeth , easy and indifferent , had been listened with much more pleasure , although she did not play so well half; and Mary , at the end of a long concerto , was happy to buy Scottish and Irish tunes and gratitude , at the request of her younger sisters , who , with some Lucases , and two or three officers , eagerly joined in the dance at one end of the room .
Mr. Darcy stood beside them , in silent indignation , in such a manner of spending the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too absorbed in his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbor .  , until Sir William begins like this: What fun for the young people , Mr. Darcy !
There is nothing like dancing after all .
I consider it one of the first refinements of polite society .  " 
Certainly , sir , and it also has the advantage of being in vogue among the less polite societies of the world .
Every savage can dance .  " 
Sir William only smiles .
" Your friend behaves deliciously , "  he continued after a pause , seeing Bingley join the group;  " and I do not doubt that you are a follower of science yourself , M .
Darcy .  " 
You saw me dancing in Meryton , I think , sir .
" Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from sight .
Do you dance often in St .
James ?  " 
" Never , sir . " 
" Do not you think that would be a proper compliment to the place ? " 
" It's a compliment I never pay anywhere if I can avoid it . " 
" Do you have a house in town , I conclude ? " 
M . Darcy s'inclina .
I had previously thought of setting myself in the city , for I love higher society , but I did not feel certain that the air of London would suit Lady Lucas .
He paused in the hope of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to do so; and at that moment Elizabeth , advancing towards them , was struck by the act of doing a very gallant thing , and called to her:  " My dear Miss Eliza , why do not you dance ?
Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to introduce you to this young woman as a very desirable partner .
You can not refuse to dance , I'm sure when so much beauty is in front of you .  " 
And , taking his hand , he would have given it to M . Darcy , who , although much surprised , would not receive it , when she drew back at once , and said with some confusion to Sir William:  " Indeed , monsieur , have no intention of dancing .
I beg you not to assume that I moved this way to beg a partner .
Mr. Darcy , with grave propriety , asked to be allowed the honor of his hand , but to no avail .
Elizabeth was determined; Sir William did not shake his goal at all by his attempt at persuasion .
- You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to refuse me the happiness of seeing you , and although this gentleman hates fun in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to to oblige us for half an hour .  " 
" Mr. Darcy is all polite , "  said Elizabeth , smiling .
It is , indeed , but , considering the incitement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not ask to his complaisance - for whom would object to such associate ?
Elizabeth looked arched , and turned away .
Her resistance had not hurt her with the gentleman , and he thought of her with a certain complacency , when Miss Bingley accosted her like this:  " I guess the subject of your reverie .
" I should not imagine . " 
You consider how unbearable it would be to spend many evenings in this way in such a society , and I fully agree with you .
I have never been more annoyed !
The insipidity , and yet the noise - the nothingness , and yet the self-importance of all these people !
What would I give to hear your stratagems about them ?
" Your guess is totally wrong , I assure you .
My mind was more pleasantly engaged .
I meditated on the great pleasure that can make two beautiful eyes in the face of a pretty woman .
Miss Bingley immediately stared at her face and wanted to tell him which lady had the merit of inspiring such reflections .
Mr. Darcy answered with great intrepidity:  " Miss Elizabeth Bennet . " 
" Mlle Elizabeth Bennet ! " 
repeated Miss Bingley .
" I am amazed .
How long has she been so favorite ? - and pray , when will I wish you joy ?
" That's exactly the question I was expecting you to ask .
The imagination of a lady is very fast . he leaps from admiration to love , from love to marriage , in a moment .
I knew you would wish me joy .  " 
" No , if you are serious about it , I will consider that the question is absolutely settled .
You will have a lovely mother-in-law; and , of course , she will always be in Pemberley with you .  " 
He listened to her with perfect indifference as she chose to be entertained thus; and as her coolness convinced her that everything was safe , her mind flowed a long time .
Chapter 7 The property of Mr. Bennet consisted almost entirely of a succession of two thousand livres a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was due , in the absence of heirs , to a distant relation; and the fortune of their mother , though sufficient for her situation in life , could only supply her deficiency .
His father had been a lawyer at Meryton and had left him four thousand pounds .
She had a sister married to a certain Mr. Phillips , who had been an employee of their father and had succeeded him in the affair , and a brother settled in London in a respectable branch of activity .
The village of Longbourn was only a mile from Meryton; the most convenient distance for young girls , who were usually tempted there three or four times a week , to pay their homework to their aunt and a milliner shop just on the way .
The two youngest members of the family , Catherine and Lydia , were particularly frequent in this care; their mind was more empty than that of their sisters , and , when nothing was better , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and provide conversations for the evening; and as little news as the country in general , they always drew something from their aunt .
At present , they were well furnished with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighborhood; he was to stay all winter , and Meryton was the headquarters .
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips now produced the most interesting intelligence .
Each day added something to their knowledge of the names and links of the officers .
Their lodging was not long a secret , and finally they began to know the officers themselves .
Mr. Phillips visited them all , which opened to his nieces a reserve of happiness previously unknown .
They could only speak of officers; and the great fortune of Mr. Bingley , whose mention animated their mother , was worthless in their eyes when she opposed the insignia of a sign .
After listening to their bestowal on the subject one morning , Mr. Bennet coldly observed:  " Of all that I can gather by your way of speaking , you must be two of the most idiotic girls in the country .
I suspected him for a while , but I am convinced now .
Catherine was disconcerted and did not answer; but Lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration for Captain Carter and his hope of seeing him during the day , as he was going the next morning to London .
" I'm amazed , my dear , "  said Mrs. Bennet ,  " that you should be so ready to think that your own stupid children .
If I wanted to think slightly about someone's children , it should not be mine .
" If my children are stupid , I must hope to be always aware of it . " 
" Yes - but in this case , they are all very smart . " 
" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .
I had hoped that our feelings would coincide in every detail , but I must differ from you in thinking that our two youngest girls are madly mad .
" My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect these girls to have the meaning of their father and mother .
When they reach our age , I dare say they will not think of the officers any more than we do .
I remember the time when I really liked a red coat - and , indeed , I always do it in my heart; and if a young intelligent colonel , with five or six thousand a year , wants one of my daughters , I will not say no to him; and I thought that Colonel Forster looked like Sir William's other night in his regiments .
" Mother , "  cried Lydia ,  " my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not often visit Miss Watson as they did at first , she now very often sees them in Clarke's library .
Mrs. Bennet was prevented from answering by the entrance of the infantryman with a note for Miss Bennet; he was coming from Netherfield , and the servant was waiting for an answer .
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure and she shouted eagerly as her daughter read ,  " Well , Jane , who is it ?
What is it about ?
What is he saying ?
Well , Jane , hurry up and tell us; Go quickly my love .
" It's from Miss Bingley , "  said Jane , and then read it out loud .
" My dear friend , - "  If you are not so compassionate as to dine with Louisa and me today , we will be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a tête-à-tête of a whole day . between two women can never end without a quarrel .
Come as soon as you can to the reception of this .
My brother and the gentlemen have dinner at the officers' . - To you , CAROLINE BINGLEY . - With the officers !
cried Lydia .
" I wonder if my aunt did not tell us about that . " 
" Dinner at the restaurant , "  said Ms . Bennet ,  " it's very unlucky . " 
" Can I have the car ? " 
dit jane
" No , my dear , it would be better for you to go on horseback , for it will probably rain , and then you will have to stay all night . " 
" That would be a good plan , "  said Elizabeth ,  " if you were sure they would not offer to send her home . " 
" Oh !
but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chair to go to Meryton , and the Hursts have no horses to theirs .
" I preferred to go in the coach . " 
" But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure .
They're wanted on the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ?
" They are hunted on the farm much more often than I can get them . " 
" But if you have them today , "  Elizabeth said ,  " my mother's goal will be answered . " 
She eventually extorted from her father a recognition that the horses were betrothed .
Jane was obliged to ride , and her mother accompanied her to the door with many happy predictions of a bad day .
His hopes have been answered; Jane had not left long before it was raining hard .
Her sisters were worried about her , but her mother was delighted .
The rain continued the whole evening without interruption; Jane certainly could not come back .
" It was a good idea of ​​mine , indeed ! " 
said Mrs. Bennet more than once , as if the merit of raining was all hers .
However , until the next morning , she was not aware of all the happiness of her invention .
The breakfast was barely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the next note to Elizabeth:  " My dear Lizzy , - "  I feel very bad this morning , which , I suppose , must be imputed to my wet yesterday .
My good friends will not hear of my return until I am better .
They also insist that I see Mr. Jones - so do not worry if you hear about his stay at home - and , apart from a sore throat and a headache , there is not much for me  . etc .  " 
" Well , my dear , "  said Mr. Bennet ,  " when Elizabeth read the note aloud , if your daughter had to have a dangerous illness , if she had to die , it would be comforting to know that everything was in pursuit of M Bingley , and under your orders .  " 
" Oh !
I'm not afraid of his death .
People do not die of insignificant small colds .
She will be well taken care of .
As long as she stays there , everything is fine .
I would go see her if I could get the car .
Elizabeth , really worried , was determined to go to her , although the carriage was not intended; and as she was not a rider , walking was her only alternative .
She declared her resolution .
" How can you be so silly , "  cried his mother ,  " as to think of such a thing , in all this filth !
You will not be worthy of being seen when you are there .
" I'll be in great shape to see Jane - that's all I want . " 
" Is it a clue , Lizzy , "  said his father ,  " to send for the horses ? " 
" No , indeed , I do not wish to avoid walking .
Distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles .
I'll be back at dinner .
" I admire the activity of your benevolence , "  observed Marie ,  " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason , and , in my opinion , the effort should always be proportionate to what is required .
" We'll go to Meryton with you , "  said Catherine and Lydia .
Elisabeth accepted their company and the three girls left together .
" If we hurry , "  Lydia said as she walked ,  " maybe we'll see something from Captain Carter before he leaves . " 
At Meryton , they separated; The two youngest went to one of the officers' wives , and Elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing the fields at a rapid pace , jumping over the stakes and jumping on puddles with impatient activity , and finally finding herself within sight . the house , with worn ankles , dirty stockings and a face radiating from the heat of exercise .
She was shown in the breakfast room , where everything except Jane was assembled , and where her appearance created a lot of surprise .
That she would have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and on her own , was almost unbelievable for Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; Elizabeth was convinced that they despised her .
She was received , however , very politely by them; and in their brother's manner there was something better than politeness; there was good humor and kindness .
Mr. Darcy said very little , and Mr. Hurst nothing at all .
The first was divided between the admiration of the brilliance which the exercise had given to her complexion , and the doubt as to the occasion which justified her coming alone .
The latter thought only of his breakfast .
His inquiries after his sister were not very favorably answered .
Miss Bennet had slept badly , and although high , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room .
Elizabeth was happy to be taken to her immediately; and Jane , who had been restrained only by the fear of giving the alarm or the inconvenience of expressing in her note how much she desired such a visit , was delighted at her entry .
She was not equal to much conversation , however , and when Miss Bingley left them together , she might have tried little to express expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with .
Elizabeth followed her silently .
When breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to love them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane .
The apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavor to carry it away; advised him to return to bed and promised him drafts .
The advice was followed easily , as the feverish symptoms increased , and his head suffered intensely .
Elizabeth did not leave her room for a moment; the other ladies were not often absent; the gentlemen being outside , they had , in fact , nothing to do elsewhere .
When the clock struck three , Elizabeth felt she had to leave , and very involuntarily she said so .
Miss Bingley offered her the car , and she only wanted a little rush to accept it , when Jane expressed such anxiety on leaving her , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chair to an invitation to stay in Netherfield to the present .  .
Elizabeth gratefully agreed , and a servant was sent to Longbourn to inform the family of his stay and bring back a supply of clothing .
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half-past six Elizabeth was called to dinner .
To the civil inquiries which then spread , and among which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley , she could not make a very favorable reply .
Jane was not better .
The sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how sad they were , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how much they hated to be sick themselves; They no longer thought of the affair , and their indifference to Jane , when they had not been at once , restored to Elizabeth the enjoyment of all her old outrages .
Their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party she could watch with any complacency .
Her concern for Jane was obvious , and her attentions to herself the most pleasant , and they prevented her from feeling so intruder that she believed she was being considered by others .
She had very little notice of anything but him .
Miss Bingley was absorbed by Mr. Darcy , his sister scarcely less; and as for Mr. Hurst , of whom Elizabeth was sitting , he was an indolent man , who only lived to eat , drink , and play cards; who , when he thought she preferred a dish to a stew , had nothing to say to him .
When the dinner was over , she returned directly to Jane , and Miss Bingley began to mistreat her as soon as she was out of the room .
His manners were pronounced to be very bad , a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation , no style , no beauty .
Mrs. Hurst thought the same thing and added ,  " She has nothing to recommend , but she is an excellent walker .
I will never forget his appearance this morning .
She really looked almost wild .  " 
" She did , indeed , Louisa .
I could barely keep my face .
Very absurd to come at all !
Why does she have to be shopping in the country because her sister had a cold ?
Her hair , so messy , so blond !  " 
" Yes , and her petticoat , I hope you have seen her petticoat six inches deep in the mud , I am absolutely sure of it , and the dress that had been dropped to hide her was not doing her service .
" Your picture may be very accurate , Louisa , "  said Bingley;  " But all this has been lost on me .
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she entered the room this morning .
His dirty petticoat escaped me .
" You have observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , "  said Miss Bingley; and I am inclined to think that you would not want to see your sister do such an exhibition .
" Certainly not . " 
" To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or anything , above his ankles in dirt , and alone , all alone !
What could she mean by that ?
It seems to me to show an abominable kind of pretentious independence , an indifference of the greater part of the country to the decorum .
" It shows affection for his sister who is very nice , "  said Bingley .
" I'm afraid , Mr. Darcy , "  said Miss Bingley in a low voice ,  " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration for her beautiful eyes .
" Not at all , "  he replied .  " they were enlightened by the exercise . " 
A short pause followed this speech , and Mrs. Hurst began again:  " I have an excessive respect for Miss Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart that she was well settled .
But with a father and a mother , and ties so low , I'm afraid there is no chance .
" I think I heard you say that their uncle is a lawyer in Meryton . " 
" Yes , and they have another one , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . " 
" It's important , "  added his sister , and they both laughed heartily .
" If they had enough uncles to fill all the Cheapside , "  cried Bingley ,  " that would not make them a less pleasant step .
" But he must drastically diminish their chances of marrying men of any consideration in the world , "  Darcy replied .
At this speech Bingley did not answer; but his sisters gave him their warm consent , and indulged their joy for a time at the expense of the vulgar relations of their dear friend .
With renewed tenderness , however , they returned to her room as they left the dining room and sat with her until they were summoned to the cafe .
She was still very poor , and Elizabeth did not leave her at all until late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep , and it seemed rather good than pleasant to go down herself .
On entering the salon she found the whole party at ten o'clock , and was immediately invited to join them; but , suspecting that they were playing high , she refused , and , making her sister excuse , said that she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay downstairs , with a book .
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment .
" Do you prefer to read cards ? " 
he said;  " It's rather singular . " 
" Miss Eliza Bennet , "  said Miss Bingley ,  " disdains cards .
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else .
" I deserve neither such praise nor censorship , "  cried Elizabeth;  " I'm not a great reader , and I have fun in a lot of things . " 
" By looking after your sister , I'm sure you have fun , "  said Bingley;  " and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing it very well . " 
Elizabeth thanked him with her heart , then went to the table where some books were lying .
He immediately offered to find the others - everything his library offered .
" And I'd like my collection to be larger for your benefit and credit , but I'm a slacker , and although I do not have a lot , I've got more than I've ever watched .  " 
Elizabeth assured her that she could perfectly fit those in the room .
" I'm amazed , "  said Miss Bingley ,  " that my father should have left so small a collection of books .
What a lovely library you have at Pemberley , M .
Darcy !  " 
" It should be fine , "  he replied ,  " it has been the work of many generations . " 
" And then you added a lot to yourself , you still buy books . " 
" I can not understand the negligence of a family library in these days . " 
" Negligence !
I'm sure you do not neglect anything that can add to the beauties of this noble place .
Charles , when you build your house , I want him to be half as charming as Pemberley .
" I wish . " 
" But I really advise you to make your purchase in this neighborhood , and take Pemberley for some sort of model .
There is no more beautiful county in England than Derbyshire .  " 
" With all my heart , I'll buy Pemberley himself if Darcy sells it . " 
" I'm talking about possibilities , Charles . " 
" On my word , Caroline , I would think that it is more possible to obtain Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . " 
Elizabeth was so taken with what was happening that she did not pay much attention to her book; and soon she set aside entirely , she approached the chart table and stood between Mr. Bingley and his older sister to watch the game .
" Has Miss Darcy grown a lot since spring ? " 
said Miss Bingley; will she be as tall as me ?
" I think she will .
She is now talking about the size of Miss Elizabeth Bennet , or rather larger .  " 
" How I want to see her again !
I have never met someone who I liked so much .
Such a face , such manners !
And so extremely accomplished for his age !
His performance on the pianoforte is exquisite .  " 
" It's amazing to me , "  said Bingley ,  " how young girls can have the patience to be so accomplished that they are all . " 
" All the girls accomplished !
My dear Charles , what do you mean ?
" Yes , all , I think .
They all paint pictures , blankets and purses .
I hardly know anyone who can not do all this , and I'm sure I've never heard of a girl for the first time , without being told she was very accomplished .
" Your list of the common reach of achievements , "  said Darcy ,  " has too much truth .
The word is applied to many women who do not deserve it other than by taking a purse or covering a screen .
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimate of ladies in general .
I can not boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my knowledge , which is really accomplished .
" Me neither , I'm sure , "  said Miss Bingley .
" Then , "  said Elizabeth ,  " you must understand very much your idea of ​​an accomplished woman .
" Yes , I really understand a lot . " 
" Oh !
" Yes , "  cried his faithful assistant ,  " no one can be truly esteemed , who does not surpass what one usually meets .
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , song , drawing , dance , and modern languages , to deserve the word; and besides all this , she must possess something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address , and her expressions , or the word will be only half-deserved .
" All that she has to possess , "  Darcy added , and for all that she must add something more substantial in improving her mind through long readings .
I am no longer surprised to know only six accomplished women .
I'm wondering now to your knowledge any .  " 
" Are you so severe on your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ?
" I have never seen such a woman .
I have never seen such an ability , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe united .  " 
Both Ms . Hurst and Miss Bingley cried out against the unfairness of her implicit doubt , and both protested that they knew many of the women who responded to this description , when Mr. Hurst called them to order . bitter complaints of their inattention to what was happening forward .
As the whole conversation was over , Elizabeth soon left the room .
" Elizabeth Bennet , "  said Miss Bingley , when the door was shut on her ,  " is one of those girls who are seeking to commend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing theirs , and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds .
But , in my opinion , it is a derisory device , a very nasty art .  " 
" No doubt , "  replied Darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly directed ,  " there is in all the arts an avarice which the ladies sometimes consent to use to captivate .
Anything that has affinity with cunning is despicable .  " 
Miss Bingley was not so completely satisfied with this answer as to continue the subject .
Elisabeth joined them to say that her sister was worse and she could not leave her .
Bingley urges Mr. Jones to be sent immediately; while his sisters , persuaded that no councils of countries could be useful , recommended to one of the most eminent physicians to go to town .
What she would not hear; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was agreed that Mr. Jones would be sent early in the morning , if Miss Bennet was not decidedly better .
Bingley was very uncomfortable; his sisters said they were miserable .
However , after supper , they relieved their misery by duets , while he found no better relief to his feelings than to give instructions to his governess so that all the attention would be given to the patient and her sister  .
Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the Head of the Night in her sister's room and had the pleasure of answering in the morning the requests she had received early from Mr. Bingley from a maid , and some time later the two elegant girls who were waiting for her sisters .
Despite this amendment , however , she asked for a ticket sent to Longbourn , wishing her mother to visit Jane , and form her own judgment of her situation .
The note was immediately shipped , and its content was quickly respected .
Mrs. Bennet , accompanied by her two youngest daughters , reached Netherfield shortly after the family breakfast .
If she had found Jane in apparent danger , Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being pleased to see that her illness was not alarming , she did not wish her to recover immediately , as her return to health would probably keep her from Netherfield .
She did not listen to her daughter's proposal to be brought home; the apothecary , who had arrived at about the same time , did not think so at all .
After sitting down a little with Jane , on the appearance and invitation of Miss Bingley , the mother and her three daughters accompanied her into the breakfast room .
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet more than expected .
" Indeed , sir , "  was his answer .
" She is far too sick to be moved .
Mr. Jones says we should not think about moving it .
We must encroach a little longer on your kindness .  " 
" Deleted " 
cried Bingley .
" It must not be thought .
My sister , I am sure , will not hear of his abduction .
" You can count on it , Madame , "  said Miss Bingley , with cold politeness ,  " that Miss Bennet will receive all possible attention while she stays with us . " 
Mrs. Bennet was abundant in her thanks .
" I am sure , "  she added ,  " that if it were not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill and suffers a great deal , but with the greatest patience in the world .  , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest character I have ever encountered .
I often tell my other daughters that they are nothing to her .
Mr. Bingley , you have here a sweet room and a lovely perspective on the gravel walk .
I do not know of any place in the country that is equal to Netherfield .
I hope you will not think of leaving it if you only have a short term lease .
" All I do is hastily done , "  he replied; and if I decided to leave Netherfield , I would probably leave in five minutes .
Currently , however , I consider myself pretty fixed here .  " 
" That's exactly what I should have assumed about you , "  said Elizabeth .
" You're starting to understand me , are not you ? " 
he exclaimed , turning to her .
" Oh !
yes - I understand you perfectly .  " 
I wish I could take this for a compliment , but be so easy to see , I'm scared , it's pitiful .
" It's like that happens .
It does not follow that a deep and complex character is more or less estimable than a character like yours .
" Lizzy , "  cried his mother ,  " remember where you are , and do not run in the wild manner you have to do at home .
" I did not know before , "  Bingley went on immediately ,  " that you were a student of character .
It must be a fun study .  " 
" Yes , but the complex characters are the most fun .
They have at least this advantage .  " 
" The country , "  says Darcy ,  " can in general furnish only a few subjects for such a study .
In a country district , you live in a very confined and invariable society .  " 
" But people themselves change so much , that there is something new to observe in them forever . " 
" Yes , indeed , "  cried Mrs. Bennet , offended by her manner of mentioning a country neighborhood .
I assure you that there are as many things happening in the countryside as in the city .
Everyone was surprised , and Darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently .
Mrs. Bennet , who believed she had gained a complete victory over him , continued his triumph .
" I do not see that London has a great advantage over the country , for my part , except shops and public places .
The country is a much nicer affair , is not it , sir ?
Bingley ?
" When I'm in the country , "  he replied ,  " I never want to leave him , and when I'm in town , it's about the same .
They each have their advantages , and I can be equally happy in one or the other .  " 
" Aye - it's because you have the right disposition .
But this gentleman ,  " looking at Darcy "  , seemed to think that the country was nothing at all .  " 
" Indeed , mother , you are mistaken , "  said Elisabeth , blushing for her mother .
" You completely confused Mr. Darcy .
He just meant that there were not as many people to meet in the country as in the city , which you must recognize to be true .
" Certainly , my dear , no one said there were , but in terms of not meeting many people in this neighborhood , I believe there are few larger neighborhoods .
I know we are dining with twenty-four families .
Elizabeth's concern alone could allow Bingley to keep her face .
His sister was less delicate and directed his eyes to Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile .
Elizabeth , to say something that might upset her mother's thoughts , asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been in Longbourn since her departure .
" Yes , she called yesterday with her father .
Sir Sir William is nice , is not it , Mr. Bingley ?
So much the man of fashion !
So nice and easy !
He always has something to say to everyone .
This is my idea of ​​a good breeding . and those people who think they are very important , and who never open their mouths , are completely mistaken .
" Did Charlotte have dinner with you ? " 
" No , she would go home .
I think she was wanted for pies .
For my part , Mr. Bingley , I always have servants who can do their own work; My daughters are raised very differently .
But everyone must judge for himself , and lucases are very good girls , I assure you .
It's a shame they are not beautiful !
Not that I think Charlotte is so simple - but then she is our special friend .  " 
" She looks like a very nice young woman . " 
" Oh !
my dear , yes; but you must own it is very simple .
Lady Lucas herself has often said it and she envied me Jane's beauty .
I do not like to brag about my own child , but to be sure , Jane - we do not often see someone more beautiful .
That's what everyone says .
I do not trust my own bias .
When she was fifteen , there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we left .
But , however , he did not do it .
Maybe she found her too young .
However , he wrote him a few verses , and they were very beautiful .
" And so ended her affection , "  said Elizabeth impatiently .
" There were many , I believe , defeated in the same way .
I wonder who discovered the effectiveness of poetry by chasing love !
" I've been used to seeing poetry as the "  fruit of love ,  " says Darcy .
" Of a good , strong and healthy love , he can .
Everything feeds what is already strong .
But if it is only a slight inclination , I am convinced that a good sonnet will starve him entirely .
Darcy only smiles . and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth fear that her mother would show herself again .
She wanted to talk , but could not think of anything to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began to repeat her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane , with excuses to trouble him too with Lizzy .
Mr. Bingley was not affectionately civil in his response , and forced his younger sister to be so civil , and to say what the occasion required .
She did her job without much kindness , but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied and soon ordered her car .
At this signal , the youngest of his daughters stands out .
The two girls had been whispering during the whole visit , and the result was that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley for having promised , at his first visit to the country , to play a ball at Netherfield .
Lydia was a fat girl of fifteen , with a beautiful complexion and a good appearance; a favorite with her mother , whose affection had brought her to the public at an early age .
She had great animal spirits , and a kind of natural consequence , that the attention of the officers , to whom the good dinners of her uncle and her easy manners had recommended her , had increased in assurance .
She was therefore very equal to address Mr. Bingley about the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it .
His response to this sudden attack was delightful in their mother's ear:  " I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement , and when your sister is healed , you will name , please , the same day of the ball .
But you would not want to dance when she's sick . Lydia declared herself satisfied .
" Oh !
yes - it would be much better to wait until Jane is well , and at that moment , Captain Carter would probably be back to Meryton .
And when you have given your ball ,  " she added , "  I will insist that they give one too .
I will tell Colonel Forster that it will be a shame if he does not do it .
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then left , and Elizabeth returned immediately to Jane , leaving her own and the conduct of her relations to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter , however , could not be forced to join their censorship of her , despite all the nonsense of Miss Bingley on the beautiful eyes .
Chapter 10 The day passed like the day before .
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent a few hours in the morning with the patient , who continued , though slowly , to repair; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the living room .
The loo-table , however , did not appear .
Mr. Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , sitting near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling his attention by messages to his sister .
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were piquet , and Mrs. Hurst was watching their game .
Elizabeth hastened to deal with what was going on between Darcy and his companion .
The perpetual eulogies of the lady , either on her writing , on the regularity of her lines , or on the length of her letter , with the perfect carelessness with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and were exactly in union with his opinion of everyone .
" As Miss Darcy will be delighted to receive such a letter ! " 
He did not answer .
" You write exceptionally fast . " 
" You're wrong .
I write rather slowly .  " 
" How many letters you must have the opportunity to write during a year !
Letters of business , too !
As I should think them !
" It's a chance , then , that they fall to my lot instead of yours . " 
" Tell your sister that I want to see her . " 
" I already told him once , by your desire . " 
" I'm afraid you do not like your pen .
Let me fix it for you .
I repair the pens very well .
" Thank you - but I always repair mine . " 
" How can you conceive of writing so even ? " 
He was silent .
- Tell your sister that I am delighted to learn of her improvement of the harp , and ask her to know that I am quite delighted with her beautiful little table for a table , and I find it infinitely superior to that of Miss Grantley .
" Will you leave me to postpone your raptures until I write again ?
For the moment I have no place to do them justice .  " 
" Oh !
it does not matter .
I'll see it in January .
But do you always write such long , charming letters ?
Darcy ?
They are usually long , but so charming it is not for me to determine .
" It's a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease , can not write badly . "   " It will not be a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , "  cried his brother ,  " because he does not write easily .
He studies too much for words of four syllables .
Not you , Darcy ?
" My writing style is very different from yours . " 
" Oh ! " 
Cried Miss Bingley , Charles writes in the most carefree manner imaginable .
He drops half of his words and sponges the rest .  " 
" My ideas flow so fast that I do not have the time to express them - which means that my letters sometimes do not convey any idea to my correspondents . " 
" Your humility , Mr. Bingley , "  said Elizabeth ,  " must disarm the reprimand . " 
" Nothing is more misleading , "  said Darcy ,  " than the appearance of humility .
It is often a negligence of opinion , and sometimes indirect boasting .
- And which of the two do you call my little modesty recent ?
" Indirect pride , because you are really proud of your writing defects , because you consider them as proceeding with a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , seems to you at least strong interesting .
The power to do anything quickly is always valued by the owner , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .
When you told Ms . Bennet this morning that if you ever decided to leave Netherfield , you would have gone in five minutes , you meant it was a kind of eulogy , a compliment to yourself - and yet , what is What is so commendable in a rush that must leave the much needed business undone , and can not be of any real benefit to you or anyone else ?  " 
" No , "  cried Bingley ,  " it's too much , to remember at night all the silly things that were said in the morning .
And yet , on my honor , I believe what I said about myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of unnecessary hurry simply to show in front of the ladies .  " 
I dare to say that you believed it , but I am not at all convinced that you would have gone so quickly .
Your conduct would depend as much on chance as on any man I know; and if , as you ride your horse , a friend had to say: Bingley , you'd better stay until next week , you probably would , you probably would not go - and in other words , could remain a months
" You have only proved by that , "  cried Elizabeth ,  " that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition .
You have shown him now much more than himself .  " 
" I am extremely satisfied , "  said Bingley ,  " converting what my friend says in a compliment about the sweetness of my mood .
But I fear you give him a trick that this gentleman did not understand at all; for he would certainly think better of me , if in such a circumstance I should give a flat denial , and leave as quickly as I could .
" Would Mr. Darcy then consider the temerity of your original intentions as compensated for your obstinacy in adhering to them ?
" On my word , I can not explain exactly the case , Darcy must speak for himself . " 
" You expect me to account for the opinions you have chosen to call mine , but which I have never recognized .
To leave the affair to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return home , and the delay of his plan , have simply desired , asked without offer an argument in favor of his property .  " 
" Easily - easily - give in to a friend's persuasion is not a credit to you . " 
" To give up without conviction is not a compliment to the understanding of one or the other . " 
" You seem to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .
A look for the plaintiff would often yield easily to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason with it .
I am not particularly speaking of a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley .
We may as well wait , perhaps , for the circumstance to occur before we discuss the discretion of his behavior on it .
But in the ordinary and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of not very big moment , should you think evil of that person to comply with the desire without wait to be discussed in ?  " 
" Would it not be advisable , before proceeding on this subject , to arrange more precisely the degree of importance which must apply to this application , as well as the degree of intimacy which exists between the parties ?
" Certainly , "  cried Bingley; Let's listen to all the details , not to mention their size and size compared , because it will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may know .
I assure you that if Darcy was not such a great man , compared to me , I should not pay him half the deference .
I declare that I do not know an object more terrible than Darcy , on particular occasions and in particular places; especially at home , and a Sunday night , when he has nothing to do .
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could see that he was rather offended , and so stopped laughing .
Miss Bingley was warmly offended at the indignity he had received in an argument with his brother for speaking of such absurdities .
" I see your drawing , Bingley , "  said his friend .
" You do not like an argument , and you want to silence it . " 
" Maybe I do it .
The arguments are too similar to arguments .
If you and Miss Bennet postpone yours until I am out of the room , I will be very grateful; and then you can say anything you love about me .  " 
" What you ask of me , "  said Elizabeth ,  " is not a sacrifice on my side , and Mr. Darcy has finished his letter much better .
Mr. Darcy followed his advice and finished his letter .
When this affair was over , he asked Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of music .
Miss Bingley moved with some eagerness to the pianoforte; and , after a polite demand that Elizabeth led the way that the other politely and more seriously negatived , she sat down .
Mrs. Hurst was singing with her sister , and while they were doing this , Elizabeth could not help but observe , by returning some of the music books that were on the instrument , how often Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her .
She could hardly suppose that she could be an object of admiration for so great a man; and yet he should look at her because he hated her , was even stranger .
She could only imagine , finally , that she was attracting his attention because there was something more wrong and more reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than with any other person present .
The supposition did not make her suffer .
She loved him too little to take care of his approval .
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm with a lively Scottish air; and soon after , M . Darcy , approaching Elizabeth , said to him:  " Do not you feel very inclined , Mademoiselle Bennet , to seize such an opportunity to dance a reel ?
She smiled , but did not answer .
He repeated the question , with some surprise to his silence .
" Oh ! " 
she said , I've heard you already , but I could not immediately determine what to answer .
You wanted , I know , to say  " yes "  , that you have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I am always pleased to overthrow such schemes and deceive a person of their premeditated contempt .
So I decided to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all - and despise me now if you dare .
" Indeed , I do not dare . " 
Elizabeth , having rather expected to insult her , was astonished at her gallantry; but there was in his way a mixture of sweetness and aridity which made it difficult for him to confront anyone; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by a woman as he was by her .
He really believed that , if it were not for the inferiority of his relationships , he should be in danger .
Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous; and his great concern for the recovery of his dear friend Jane has received some support from his desire to get rid of Elizabeth .
She often tried to provoke Darcy to dislike her host , by talking about their supposed marriage , and by planning her happiness in such an alliance .
" I hope , "  said she , walking the next day into the bushes ,  " that you will give your mother-in-law some hints , when this desirable event takes place , on the advantage of being silent; and if you can use it , have the girls heal after the officers .
And , if I can mention such a delicate subject , try to check this little something , at the limit of the vanity and impertinence that your wife possesses .
" Do you have anything else to offer for my domestic bliss ? " 
" Oh !
Yes .
Leave the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips in the Pemberley Gallery .
Put them next to your great-uncle judge .
They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines .
As for the picture of your Elizabeth , you should not take it , because what painter could do justice to these beautiful eyes ?
" It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their color and shape , and eyelashes , so remarkably well , could be copied . " 
At that moment they were met with another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself .
" I did not know you intended to walk , "  said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they be heard .
" You used us abominably ill , "  replied Mrs. Hurst ,  " running away without telling us that you are going out .
Then , taking Mr. Darcy's disengaged arm , she left Elizabeth to walk alone .
The path just admitted three .
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said ,  " This walk is not wide enough for our party .
We'd better go to the avenue .  " 
But Elizabeth , who had not the least desire to stay with them , replied with a laugh ,  " No , no , stay where you are .
You are grouped with charm and you seem to have a rare advantage .
The picturesque would be spoiled by admitting a fourth .
Goodbye . " 
She runs away cheerfully , rejoicing as she strolls , hoping to be home again in a day or two .
Jane was already so well recovered that she was planning to leave her room a few hours that night .
CHAPTER 11 When the ladies retired after dinner , Elizabeth ran to her sister , and , seeing her well protected from the cold , accompanied her to the drawing-room , where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were at the hour which preceded the appearance of the gentlemen .
Their powers of conversation were considerable .
They can describe an entertainment accurately , tell an anecdote with humor and laugh about their knowledge of the mind .
But when the gentlemen entered , Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned to Darcy , and she had something to say to him before he took many steps .
He addressed Miss Bennet , with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also gave him a slight bow and said he was  " very happy "  . but sweetness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation .
He was full of joy and attention .
The first half hour was spent stacking the fire for fear of suffering from the change of room; and she removed to her desire on the other side of the chimney , that she might be further away from the door .
He sat down next to her and did not speak to anyone else .
Elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw everything with a lot of pleasure .
When tea was over , Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card table , but to no avail .
She had obtained private information that Mr. Darcy did not want cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected .
She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of everyone on the subject seemed to justify it .
Mr. Hurst had nothing to do , but to lie down on one of the sofas and fall asleep .
Darcy took a book; Miss Bingley did the same thing; and Mrs. Hurst , who was busy playing with her bracelets and rings , occasionally joined her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet .
Miss Bingley's attention was as busy looking at Mr. Darcy's progress through his book as reading his own; and she was perpetually investigating or looking at her page .
She could not , however , win him any conversation; he simply answered his question and continued to read .
At the end , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume , she yawned and said ,  " How nice it is to spend an evening this way !
I declare after all that there is no pleasure like reading !
How much earlier we get tired of nothing but a book !
When I have a house , I will be miserable if I do not have an excellent library .
Nobody answered .
She yawned again , threw her book and looked into the room for some amusement; Hearing her brother speak to Miss Bennet , she turned abruptly to him and said ,  " By the way , Charles , are you really serious about meditating a dance in Netherfield ? " 
I advise you , before you decide , to consult the wishes of this part; I am very much mistaken if there are none among us to whom a ball would be a punishment rather than a pleasure .
" If you want to talk about Darcy , "  cried his brother ,  " he'll go to bed , if he wants to , before he starts , but as for the ball , it's a well-regulated thing , and as soon as that Nicholls made enough white soup I will send my cards .
" I would prefer infinitely better balls , "  she said ,  " if they went on in a different way , but there is something unbearably boring in the usual process of such a meeting .
It would surely be much more rational if the conversation instead of dancing was on the agenda .
" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be so close to a ball . " 
Miss Bingley did not answer , and soon after she got up and walked into the room .
Her figure was elegant and she worked well; but Darcy , to whom all this was destined , was always inflexibly studious .
In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved one more effort , and , turning to Elizabeth , said ,  " Miss Eliza Bennet , allow me to persuade you to follow my example , and go around the room .
I assure you that it is very refreshing after sitting so long in an attitude .  " 
Elizabeth was surprised , but accepted immediately .
Miss Bingley succeeds no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up .
He was just as alert to the novelty of the neighborhood's attention as Elizabeth herself , and closed her book unconsciously .
He was directly invited to join their group , but he refused , observing that he could only imagine two reasons why they would choose to walk together in the room , with one or other of the reasons why he would join them .
What could he mean ?
She was dying to know what could be her meaning ?
--and asked Elizabeth if she could understand it ?
" Not at all , "  was his answer; but depend on it , he wants to punish us , and our surest way to disappoint him will be to ask nothing of him .
Miss Bingley , however , was unable to disappoint Mr. Darcy in anything , and persevered in demanding an explanation of his two motives .
" I have no objection to explain to them , "  he said , as soon as she allowed him to speak .
" Either you choose this method to spend the evening , because you are in the confidence of the other , and you have secret business to discuss , or because you are aware that your figures have the advantage of walking; in your own way , and if the second , I can admire you much better than I sit by the fire .  " 
" Oh !
shocking ! " 
cried Miss Bingley .
" I have never heard anything so abominable .
How will we punish him for such a speech ?
" It's not easy , if you only have the inclination , "  Elizabeth said .
" We can all torment each other and punish one another .
Tease him - laugh at him .
Intimate as you are , you must know how it should be done .  " 
" But on my honor , I do not not .
I assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .
Quiet tease of the way and the presence of mind !
No no; I think he can challenge us there .
And as for laughter , we will not expose ourselves , please , trying to laugh without a subject .
Mr. Darcy can hug .  " 
" We do not make fun of Mr. Darcy ! " 
exclaimed Elizabeth .
" It's a rare benefit , and I hope it will continue , because it would be a great loss for me to have a lot of that knowledge .
I love to laugh .  " 
" Miss Bingley , "  he said ,  " has given me more credit than can be .
The wisest and best of men - and even the wisest and best of their deeds - can be made ridiculous by someone whose first object in life is a joke .  " 
" Certainly , "  answered Elizabeth -  " there are such people , but I hope I am not one of them .
I hope never to make fun of what is wise and good .
Foolishness and nonsense , caprices and inconsistencies distract me , I possess them , and I laugh at them whenever I can .
But those , I suppose , are precisely what you are without .
" Maybe it's not possible for anyone .
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses that often expose a strong understanding to ridicule .  " 
" Such as vanity and pride . " 
" Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .
But pride - where there is a real superiority of spirit , the pride will always be in good regulation .  " 
Elizabeth turned to hide a smile .
" Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , "  said Miss Bingley;  " and pray what is the result ? " 
" I am perfectly convinced that Mr. Darcy has no defect .
He owns it himself without disguise .  " 
" No , "  said Darcy ,  " I did not make such a claim .
I have enough flaws , but they are not , I hope , understanding .
My mood , I dare not vouch .
It is , I believe , too unproductive - certainly not enough for the convenience of the world .
I can not forget the follies and vices of others as soon as I should , nor their offenses against myself .
My feelings are not inflated with every attempt to move them .
My character might be qualified as spiteful .
My good opinion , once lost , is lost forever .  " 
" That is a failure indeed ! " 
exclaimed Elizabeth .
" Relentless resentment is a nuance in a character .
But you have chosen your fault .
I really can not laugh .
You are safe from me .  " 
" There is , I believe , in every provision a tendency to a particular evil - a natural defect that even the best education can not overcome "  .
" And your fault is to hate everyone . " 
" And yours , "  he replied with a smile ,  " willingly to misinterpret them . " 
" Let's do some music , "  cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation she had no part in .
" Louisa , you do not mind my waking
Hurst ?
His sister had no objection , and the pianoforte was open; and Darcy , after a few moments of memory , was not sorry .
He began to feel the danger of paying too much attention to Elizabeth .
Chapter 12 Following an agreement between the sisters , Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother asking that the car be sent to them during the day .
But Mrs. Bennet , who had calculated that her daughters would stay in Netherfield until the following Tuesday , which would end exactly Jane's week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before .
Her answer was therefore not favorable , at least not to Elisabeth's wishes , for she was impatient to return home .
Ms . Bennet told them they could not get the car until Tuesday; and in his postscript it was added that if Mr. Bingley and his sister urged them to stay longer , she might well spare them .
However , to stay longer , Elizabeth was positively resolved - and she did not expect him to be asked either; fearing , on the contrary , that she would be regarded as unnecessarily intruding , she urged Jane to immediately borrow Mr. Bingley's car , and it was finally decided that their original intention to leave Netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made .
Communication has excited many occupations of concern; It was enough to wish them at least the next day to work on Jane; and until the next day their departure was postponed .
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had suggested the delay , because her jealousy and dislike of one sister greatly exceeded her affection for the other .
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were going so fast , and tried several times to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be without danger for her - that she was not sufficiently recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt right .
For Darcy , intelligence was welcome - Elizabeth had been in Netherfield for quite some time .
She attracted him more than he loved her - and Miss Bingley was uncivil for her , and more teasing than usual for himself .
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate him with the hope of influencing his bliss; Be aware that if such an idea had been suggested , its behavior on the last day must have a material weight in the confirmation or crash .
Faithful to his design , he did not say ten words to him all the Saturday , and although they had been alone for half an hour , he adhered conscientiously to his book and did not even look at it .  .
On Sunday , after morning service , the separation , so pleasant to almost all , took place .
Miss Bingley's courtesy to Elizabeth grew finally very quickly , as did her affection for Jane; and when they parted , after having assured him the pleasure , he always gave her a visit to Longbourn or Netherfield , and , kissing her with tenderness , she even shook his hand .
Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits .
They were not greeted very cordially by their mother .
Mrs. Bennet wondered about their coming , and thought they were wrong to give so much harm , and was sure that Jane would still have caught cold .
But their father , although very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really happy to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle .
The evening conversation , when they were all together , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its meaning by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth .
They found Mary , as usual , deeply in the study of the deep nature and the human nature; and had some extracts to admire , and some new observations of morality used to listen .
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different kind .
Much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the previous Wednesday; several officers had recently dined with their uncle , a soldier had been whipped , and it had even been suggested that Colonel Forster was getting married .
Chapter 13  " I hope , my dear , "  said Mr. Bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning ,  " that you ordered a good dinner today , because I'm right about 'wait for an addition to our family's party .'
" Who do you want to say , my dear ?
I'm not sure anyone will come , unless Charlotte Lucas intervenes - and I hope my dinners are good enough for her .
I do not think she often sees at home .  " 
" The person I'm talking about is a gentleman and a stranger . " 
Mrs. Bennet's eyes shone .
" A gentleman and a stranger !
It's Mr. Bingley , I'm sure !
Well , I'm sure I'll be extremely happy to see Mr. Bingley .
But - good God !
how unlucky !
There is not a little fish to get today .
Lydia , my love , ring the bell - I have to talk to Hill this moment .  " 
" It's not Mr. Bingley , "  said her husband; he is a person I have never seen in the whole course of my life .
This provoked a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being closely interrogated by his wife and five daughters at a time .
After having amused himself for some time with their curiosity , he explained thus:  " About a month ago , I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered him , for I found it a little delicate and requiring early attention .
It's from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I'm dead , will be able to drive you out of this house whenever he wants .
" Oh !
my dear ,  " cried his wife , "  I can not bear to hear that .
Pray , do not talk about this odious man .
I think this is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be far from your own children; and I am sure , if I had been you , I would have tried for a long time to do something about it .
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an involvement .
They had often tried to do it before , but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was out of reach of reason , and she continued to bitterly complain about the cruelty of settling a domain away from a family of five girls  , in favor of a man nobody cared about .
" It's certainly a most unfair affair , "  said Mr. Bennet ,  " and nothing can erase Mr. Collins's guilt of inheriting Longbourn .
But if you listen to his letter , you may be a little softened by his way of expressing himself .
" No , I am sure of it , and I think it is very impertinent to write to you , and very hypocritical .
I hate these fake friends .
Why can not he continue to quarrel with you , as his father did before him ?  " 
" Why , indeed , he seems to have had filial scruples on this head , as you will hear .
" Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , October 15th .
Dear Sir , - The disagreement which subsisted between you and my deceased father has always given me much anxiety , and since I had the misfortune to lose it , I often wanted to heal the breach; but , for a time , I was detained by my own doubts , fearing that it would seem to disrespect his memory for me to be on good terms with someone with whom he had always had pleasure in disagreeing .
Bennet .
- But my idea is now made on the subject , because , having been ordained at Easter , I had the chance to distinguish myself under the patronage of the Right Honorable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose goodness and benevolence have preferred me to the precious presbytery of this parish , where I will do my utmost to lower myself with grateful respect to his lordship , and always be ready to perform the rites and ceremonies instituted by the Church . from England .  .
As a pastor , I feel my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my next presence in the domain of Longbourn will be kindly neglected on your side , and will not lead you to reject the olive branch offered .
I can not be otherwise preoccupied with being a means of injuring your kindly daughters , and I beg you to excuse me for that , as well as to assure me of my eagerness to make them all possible reparations - but of this following .
If you have no objection to receiving me at home , I propose to wait for you and your family on Monday , November 18 , at four o'clock , and to encroach on your hospitality until Saturday evening . the following , which I can do without inconvenience , for Lady Catherine is far from opposing my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided another ecclesiastic is engaged to do the duty of the day . - I remain , my dear sir , respectful WILLIAM COLLINS .  " At four o'clock , then , we can expect this peacemaker gentleman , "  said Mr. Bennet , folding the letter .
" He seems to be a very conscientious and polite young man , on my word , and I do not doubt to prove a valuable knowledge , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent to let him come back to us . " 
There is , however , a sense in what he says about girls , and if he is willing to make amends to them , I will not be the person to discourage him .
" Although it is difficult , "  said Jane ,  " to guess how he may want to make the atonement he thinks he owes , the wish is certainly to his credit . " 
Elizabeth was especially struck by her extraordinary deference to Lady Catherine , and her benevolent intention of baptizing , marrying , and burying her parishioners when necessary .
" It must be a curiosity , I think , "  she said .
" I can not get him out . "   " There's something very pompous about his style . "  And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the business ? not suppose he would help if he could , he's a sensible man , sir ?
" No , my dear , I do not think so .
I have great hopes of finding it quite the opposite .
There is a mixture of servility and sufficiency in his letter , which promises well .
I can not wait to see him .  " 
" At the point of composition , "  says Mary ,  " the letter does not seem defective .
The idea of ​​the olive branch may not be entirely new , but I think it is well expressed .  " 
For Catherine and Lydia , neither the letter nor its author was interesting .
It was almost impossible for their cousin in a scarlet cloak , and it had been a few weeks since they had received the pleasure of the society of a man of any other color .
As for their mother , Mr. Collins' letter had removed much of his ill-will , and she was preparing to see him with a coolness that astonished her husband and daughters .
Mr. Collins was punctual in his day and was received with great politeness by the whole family .
Mr. Bennet did say little; but the ladies were ready to speak , and Mr. Collins did not seem to need to be encouraged or inclined to shut up himself .
He was a young man of twenty-five , tall and heavy .
His air was grave and majestic , and his manners were very formal .
He had not been sitting long before congratulating Mrs. Bennet on having such a beautiful family of girls; said that he had heard much of their beauty , but that in this case fame had fallen short of the truth; and added that he did not doubt that she saw them all in due time arranged in marriage .
This gallantry was not to the liking of some of his listeners; but Mrs. Bennet , who disputed without compliments , answered willingly .
You are very kind , I am sure , and I wish it with all my heart , because otherwise they will be quite poor .
Things are regulated so strangely .  " 
You may be referring to the implication of this area .
" Ah !
sir , indeed .
This is a painful affair for my poor girls , you must admit .
Not that I want to reproach you because I know that all these things are opportunities in this world .
It is unclear how states will go when they come to be trained .  " 
I am very sensitive , Madame , to the difficulties of my beautiful cousins , and I could say a lot on the subject , but that I take care not to appear and rush .
But I can assure the girls that I come to admire them .
For the moment I will not say more; but , perhaps , when we better know  . . . He was interrupted by a call to dinner , and the girls smiled at each other .
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins' admiration .
The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture were examined and rented; and her recommendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of her look upon everything as her own future property .
Dinner , too , was highly admired; and he asked to know to whom his beautiful cousins ​​owed the excellence of his cooking .
But he was put there by Mrs. Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very good at keeping a good cook , and that his daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen .
He asked forgiveness for having displeased him .
In a softened tone she did not declare herself offended at all; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour .
Chapter 14 During dinner , Mr. Bennet hardly spoke; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it was time to have a conversation with his host , and so began a subject where he expected him to shine , observing that he seemed very lucky at his house . patroness .
The attention of Lady Catherine de Bourgh to her wishes , and consideration for her comfort , seemed very remarkable .
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better .
Mr. Collins was eloquent in his praise .
The subject raised him to a solemnity more than usual in the way , and with a most important aspect he protested that  " he had never seen such behavior in a person of rank - such affability and condescension , as he he himself had experienced Catherine .
She had been graciously pleased to approve the two speeches he had already had the honor of preaching before her .
She had also twice asked him to dine at Rosings , and only had him come the previous Saturday , to prepare his quadrille pool in the evening .
Lady Catherine was considered proud by many people he knew , but she had never seen anything but affability in her .
She had always spoken to him as to every other gentleman; she made no objection to entering the neighborhood society or leaving the parish from time to time for a week or two to visit her parents .
She had even deigned to advise her to marry as soon as possible , provided she chose with discretion; and had once visited him in his humble presbytery , where she had thoroughly approved all the modifications he had made , and had even agreed to suggest some - a few shelves in the cupboard of the stairs .
I'm sure all this is very clean and civil , says Mrs. Bennet , and I dare say she's a very nice woman .
It is a shame that big ladies in general do not look like her .
Does she live near you , sir ?
" The garden in which my humble dwelling is is only separated by an alleyway from Rosings Park , his lady's residence . " 
" I think you said she was a widow , sir ?
Does she have a family ?
" She has only one daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and very extensive property . " 
" Ah ! " 
Bennet said , shaking her head , so she's better off than many girls .
And what kind of young woman is she ?
Is she beautiful ?  " 
" She is indeed a charming young woman .
Lady Catherine herself says that , to the point of true beauty , Mademoiselle de Bourgh is by far superior to the most beautiful of her sex , because there are some in her features that mark the girl of distinguished birth .
She is unfortunately of a morbid constitution , which has prevented her from making this progress in many accomplishments that she could not otherwise have failed , as informed by the lady who supervised her education , and who remains always with them .
But she is perfectly lovable and condescends often to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and her ponies .
" Has it been presented ?
I do not remember his name among the ladies of the court .
" His indifferent state of health unfortunately prevents him from being in town , and by this means , as I said to Lady Catherine one day , she has deprived the English court of her most beautiful ornament .
His lady seemed happy with the idea; and you can imagine that I am happy at every opportunity to offer these delicate little compliments that are always acceptable to the ladies .
I have more than once remarked to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the highest rank , instead of giving her the consequence , would be adorned by her .
These are the kind of little things that please his wife , and it's a kind of attention that I feel particularly obliged to pay .
" You judge very well , "  said Mr. Bennet ,  " and it is fortunate for you that you have the talent to flatter with delicacy .
May I ask whether these pleasant attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of an earlier study ?
" They come mainly from what is happening at the time , and although I sometimes have fun to suggest and organize small compliments so elegant and adapted to ordinary occasions , I always want to give them an air as little studied as possible  .
Mr. Bennet's expectations have been fully answered .
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to her with the greatest pleasure , at the same time maintaining the most resolute calmness of his face , and , save for an occasional glance at Elizabeth , asking no partner for his pleasure .
At tea time , however , the dose was sufficient , and Mr. Bennet was happy to take his guest back to the drawing-room , and when the tea was over , pleased to invite him to read aloud to the ladies .
Mr. Collins readily accepted , and a book was produced; but on seeing him (for everything announced that he was coming from a library in circulation) he drew back , and , asking pardon , protested that he never read novels .
Kitty looked at him , and Lydia exclaimed .
Other books were produced , and after deliberation he chose Fordyce's sermons .
Lydia gaped at opening the volume , and before he had read , with a very monotonous solemnity , three pages , she interrupted him:  " Do you know , my mother , that my uncle Phillips speaks of turning away from Richard , and if he does , Colonel ? Forster will hire him .
My aunt told me that herself Saturday .
I'll be walking to Meryton tomorrow to find out more and ask when Mr. Denny will come back from town .
Lydia was asked by her two older sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins , much offended , put aside his book and said:  " I have often remarked how much the girls are interested in books of a serious character , though written solely for their benefit .
This surprises me , I admit it; for , of course , nothing can be as beneficial to them as instruction .
But I do not want to bother my young cousin anymore .
Then turning to Mr. Bennet , he offered himself as his backgammon antagonist .
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely by leaving the girls to their own insignificant distractions .
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters excused themselves more civilly for the interruption of Lydia , and promised that it should not happen again , if he should resume his book; but Mr. Collins , after having assured them that he bore no ill-will to his young cousin , and should never be angry with him , sat down at another table with Mr. Bennet , and prepared for the backgammon .
Chapter 15 Mr. Collins was not a sensible man , and the inadequacy of nature had been little helped by education or society; most of his life having been under the direction of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he had belonged to one of the universities , he had simply kept the necessary conditions , without having any useful knowledge of them .
The subjection in which his father had raised him had originally given him a great humility of manners; but it was now much counterbalanced by the self-esteem of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequent feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .
A lucky chance had recommended it to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , when the living of Hunsford were vacant; and the respect which he felt for his high rank , and his veneration for her as his patron , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his ecclesiastical authority , and of his right of rector , rendered him everything a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self-importance and humility .
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income , he intended to get married; and , seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family , he had a woman in sight , since he wanted to choose one of the girls , if he found them as beautiful and amiable as represented by a common report .
It was his plan of fine - atonement - to inherit the property of their father; and he found it excellent , full of eligibility and propriety , exceedingly generous , and disinterested on his part .
His plan did not change when he saw them .
The pretty face of Miss Bennet confirmed her views and established all her strictest ideas as to what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his choice settled .
The next morning , however , did an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's conversation with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast , a conversation commencing with her presbytery house , and naturally leading to the avowal of her hopes , that a mistress could be found for her at Longbourn , produced from her , in the midst of very complacent smiles and general encouragement , a warning against the same Jane he had fixed .
" As for her youngest daughters , she could not take it upon herself to say - she could not respond positively - but she knew no pre ssession , her unmarried daughter , she just has to mention it - she felt compelled to index , was likely to be very soon engaged .  " 
Mr. Collins had only to go from Jane to Elizabeth - and it was soon done - while Mrs. Bennet stirred the fire .
Elizabeth , also next to Jane in birth and beauty , succeeded him of course .
Mrs. Bennet kept the hint , and hoped that she might soon have two married daughters; and the man she could not bear to talk about yesterday was now high in her good graces .
Lydia's intention to walk to Meryton has not been forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend , at the request of Mr. Bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and at his library; for Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the greatest folios in the collection , but really speak to Mr. Bennet , with little cessation , of his home and garden at Hunsford .
Such actions have greatly puzzled Mr. Bennet .
In his library he had always been sure of his leisure and tranquility; and although prepared , as he said Elizabeth , to meet folly and vanity in every other room of the house , he used to be free of them there; his courtesy invited M . Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins , being in fact much better suited for a walker than a reader , was extremely happy to close his big book , and go .
On his side , in pompous nothingness , and civil seats on those of his cousins , their time passed to Meryton .
The attention of the youngest was no longer acquired by him .
Their eyes were strolling down the street in search of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart cap indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recall them .
But the attention of all the women was soon seized by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of the greatest appearance of gentleman , walking with another officer on the other side of the road .
The officer was the very Mr. Denny about the return from London where Lydia came to inquire , and he bowed in passing .
All were struck with the air of the stranger , all wondering who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia , determined if possible to find out , were on the other side of the street , pretending to want something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just reached the sidewalk when the two gentlemen , returning , had reached the same place .
Mr. Denny spoke directly to them , and asked permission to introduce his friend , Mr. Wickham , who had returned the day before with him from the city , and he was happy to say that he had accepted a commission in their body  .
It was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regiments to make him completely charming .
His appearance was greatly in his favor; he had all that was most beautiful , a beautiful face , a good figure and a very pleasant address .
The introduction was followed by a good disposition of the conversation - a preparation at once perfectly correct and unpretentious; and everyone was still standing and speaking very well , when the noise of the horses caught their attention , and Darcy and Bingley were seen in the street .
In distinguishing the ladies from the group , the two gentlemen came directly to them , and began the usual civilities .
Bingley was the chief spokesman , and Miss Bennet the main object .
He was then , he said , on the way to Longbourn to inquire about her .
Mr. Darcy corroborated him with a bow , and began not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth , when they were suddenly stopped at the sight of the stranger , and that Elizabeth came to see the face of the two looking at each other . the other , was quite surprised at the effect of the meeting .
Both changed color , one appeared white , the other red .
Mr. Wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat - a greeting that Mr. Darcy just deigned to return .
What could be the meaning ?
It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to know too much .
In a minute , Mr. Bingley , though not seeming to have noticed what was happening , took leave and went off with his friend .
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham went with the girls to the door of Mr. Phillip's house , then bowed , despite Miss Lydia's urging them to come in , and even though Mrs. Phillips vomit the living room window and loudly pressing the invitation .
Mrs. Phillips was always happy to see her nieces; and the two eldest , by their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she eagerly expressed her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own car had not pulled them , she should have known nothing , if she had not come to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street , who had told him that they were not to send drafts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were back , when his politeness had been demanded from Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction .
She received him with his greatest politeness , that he returned with much more , apologizing for his intrusion , without any previous knowledge of her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , could be justified by his relationship with the girls who presented him in his opinion .
Mrs. Phillips was very impressed by such an excess of good breeding; but his contemplation of a stranger was soon terminated by exclamations and questions about the other; from whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that Mr. Denny had brought him from London , and that he must have a lieutenant commission in the County .
She had watched it last time , she said , as he walked down the street , and if Mr. Wickham appeared , Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unfortunately , no one has gone through the windows now , except for a few of the officers who , from abroad , had become  " stupid and unpleasant people "  .
Some of them were to dine with the Phillips the next day , and their aunt promised to ask her husband to call Mr. Wickham and give him an invitation if the Longbourn family came in the evening .
This was accepted , and Ms . Phillips protested that they would have a nice noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little hot supper afterwards .
The prospect of these delights was very encouraging , and they parted in mutual good humor .
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies as he left the room , and was assured with unwavering civility that they were perfectly useless .
When she returned , Elizabeth told Jane what she had seen passing between the two gentlemen; but although Jane had defended one or the other , or both , if they had looked wrong , she could no more explain such behavior than her sister .
Mr. Collins , on his return , greatly appreciated Ms . Bennet admiring the manner and politeness of Ms . Phillips .
He protested that , except Lady Catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the greatest civility , but had even included him in his invitation for the following evening , although she was absolutely unknown to him before .
Something , he supposed , could be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never seen so much attention in the course of his life .
Chapter 16 No objection was made to the youth's engagement with their aunt , and all Mr. Collins' scruples about leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for one evening during his visit met with constant resistance . The coach transported him and his five cousins ​​at a convenient hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the salon , that Mr. Wickham had accepted the invitation of their uncle , and was then in the house .
When this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around and admire , and he was so struck by the size and furniture of the apartment that he was stated that he would have almost assumed himself in the small summer breakfast room at Rosings; a comparison which did not at first give much satisfaction; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from her what Rosings was , and who was her owner - when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's salons , and found that the fireplace alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the strength of the compliment , and would hardly have felt a comparison with the housekeeper's room .
In describing to him all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her house , with occasional digressions to the glory of her humble home and the improvements she received , he was happy until the gentlemen joined them; and he found at Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of its consequence increased with what she heard , and who resolved to sell it to all her neighbors as soon as she could .
To the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to want an instrument , and to examine their own indifferent imitations of porcelain on the mantelpiece , the interval of waiting seemed very long .
It was finally over , though .
The gentlemen drew near , and when Mr. Wickham entered the room Elizabeth felt that she had never seen him before , nor had thought of him ever since , with the least irrational admiration .
The officers of the county were generally a very honorable , gentleman-worthy group , and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was so far above them all in person , the face , the air , and the walk , for they were superior to the muffled uncle and broad face , breathing the port wine , which followed them in the room .
Mr. Wickham was the happy man to whom almost all female eyes were turned , and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally sat; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately began to speak , though it was only a damp night , made him feel that the most vulgar , the most dull , the most worn-out subject could be made interesting by the skill of the speaker .
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers , Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies it was certainly nothing; but he still had from time to time a kind hearer in Mrs. Phillips , and was by her watch , most abundantly furnished with coffee and muffin .
When the card tables were placed , he had the opportunity to take turns , sitting down to whistle .
" I do not know much about the game , "  he says ,  " but I'll be happy to improve , because in my situation in life  . . . "  Ms . Phillips was very happy with her compliance , but could not wait for his reason .
Mr. Wickham did not play whist , and he was delighted to have received it at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia .
At first , it seemed risky for Lydia to absorb her entirely , for she was a very determined talker; but being also very fond of lottery tickets , she is more and more interested in gambling , too eager to make bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular .
Given the common requirements of the game , Mr. Wickham was therefore free to speak to Elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear it , although what she mostly wanted to hear , she could not hope to be told - the story of his knowledge with Mr. Darcy .
She did not even dare to talk about this gentleman .
His curiosity , however , was relieved unexpectedly .
Mr. Wickham started the subject himself .
He asked how far was Netherfield from Meryton; and , after receiving his answer , hesitantly asked how long Mr. Darcy had remained there .
" About a month , "  said Elizabeth; then , not wanting to drop the subject , he added:  " He is a man of very great property in Derbyshire , I understand .
" Yes , "  answered Mr. Wickham;  " His estate is a noble .
A clear ten thousand a year .
You could not have met a person more able to give you some information about this leader than me , because I was connected to his family in a particular way from my childhood .  " 
Elizabeth could only seem surprised .
You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , by such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably could , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday .
Do you know a lot M .
Darcy ?
" As much as I wish , "  exclaimed Elizabeth , very warmly .
I spent four days in the same house with him , and I find him very unpleasant .
" I have no right to give my opinion , "  said Wickham ,  " as to his being pleasant or otherwise .
I am not qualified to form one .
I've known him for too long and too well to be a good judge .
It is impossible for me to be impartial .
But I think your opinion of him would be surprising in general - and maybe you would not express it so strongly elsewhere .
Here you are in your own family .  " 
" On my word , I do not say over there that I could say in any house in the neighborhood , except Netherfield .
He is not liked at all in Hertfordshire .
Everyone is disgusted with his pride .
You will not find it favorably spoken by anyone .  " 
" I can not pretend to be sorry , "  said Wickham , after a short interruption ,  " that he or that any man should not be esteemed beyond their deserts , but with him , I believe that it does not not happen often .
The world is blinded by its fortune and its consequences , or frightened by its lofty and imposing manners , and sees it only as it chooses to be seen .  " 
" I should take it , even on my slight acquaintance , to be a moody man . " 
Wickham only shook his head .
" I wonder , "  he said , at the next opportunity to speak ,  " if he's likely to be in this country much longer . " 
I do not know at all , but I did not hear of his departure when I was in Netherfield .
I hope your plans for the County will not be affected by his stay in the neighborhood .  " 
" Oh !
no , it's not for me to be chased by Mr. Darcy .
If she wants to avoid seeing me , he has to leave .
We are not friendly , and it always hurts me to meet him , but I have no reason to avoid him , but what I could proclaim in front of everyone , a feeling of very bad use , and the most painful regret for him . to be what it is .
His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men who breathed and the most true friend I ever had; and I can never be in the company of this Mr. Darcy without being afflicted to the soul by a thousand tender memories .
His behavior to me was scandalous; but I really believe that I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than disappoint his hopes and dishonor his father's memory .
Elizabeth found the interest of the growing subject , and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further investigation .
Mr. Wickham began to speak of more general subjects , Meryton , the neighborhood , the society , seeming very happy with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter with a sweet but very intelligible gallantry .
" It was the perspective of constant society and good society , "  he added ,  " which has been my main incentive to enter the county .
I knew it was a very respectable and agreeable body , and my friend Denny still tempted me by his account of their present quarters , and by the great attentions and excellent knowledge that Meryton had given them .
Society , I own , is necessary for me .
I have been a disappointed man , and my minds will not bear loneliness .
I just have to have jobs and society .
A military life is not what I was meant for , but circumstances have now made it eligible .
The church must have been my profession - I was raised for the church , and I would have had a very precious life right now , if it had pleased the gentleman we were talking about earlier .
" Effectively ! " 
" Yes - the late Mr. Darcy left me the next presentation of the best life in his gift .
He was my godfather , and overly attached to me .
I can not do justice to his kindness .
He intended to give me ample , and thought he had done it; but when the living fell , they were given elsewhere .  " 
" God's goodness ! " 
exclaimed Elizabeth; but how could it be ?
How could his will be ignored ?
Why did not you ask for compensation ?  " 
" There was just such informality in the terms of the legacy as to give me no hope of the law .
A man of honor could not doubt the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it - or to treat it as a mere conditional recommendation , and to affirm that I had lost all pretense by extravagance , imprudence - in a word nothing or nothing .
It is certain that the living thing became vacant two years ago , just as I was old enough to hold it , and that it was given to another man; and it is none the less certain that I can not accuse myself of having really done something to deserve to lose it .
I have a lukewarm , helpless temper , and I have been able to speak too freely about him and him .
I do not remember anything worse .
But the fact is that we are very different men and hate me .
" It's quite shocking !
It deserves to be publicly disgraced .  " 
" One day or another , it will be - but it will not be through me .
Until I can forget his father , I will never be able to challenge him or expose him .
Elizabeth honored him for such feelings , and found him more beautiful than ever as he expressed them .
" But what , "  she said after a pause ,  " perhaps her motive ?
What may have led him to behave so cruelly ?
" A deep and determined dislike of me - an aversion that I can only attribute to a certain extent to jealousy .
If the late Mr. Darcy loved me less , his son would have borne me better; but the rare attachment of his father to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life .
He did not have the temper to endure the kind of competition we were in - the kind of preference that I was often given .
" I did not think Mr. Darcy was that bad-though I never liked him .
I had not thought so bad of him .
I had supposed him to despise his fellows in general , but I did not suspect him of falling into so vicious a vengeance , such an injustice , such inhumanity .
After a few minutes of reflection , however , she continued:  " I remember his pride one day at Netherfield , the implacability of his resentment , his ruthlessness .
His disposition must be terrible .  " 
" I will not trust on the subject , "  answered Wickham;  " I can hardly be fair to him . " 
Elizabeth was again in her thoughts and , after a while , she exclaimed:  " Treat the godson , the friend , the favorite of his father !
She could have added:  " A young man , too , like you , whose very face can guarantee your kindness "  - but she was content with  "  , and one , too , who had probably been his childhood companion , connected together , as I think you said it , in the closest way !
" We were born in the same parish , in the same park , most of our youth was spent together , the inmates of the same house , sharing the same fun , objects of the same parental care .
My father started life in the profession that your uncle , Mr. Phillips , seems to be doing a lot of credit for - but he gave up everything to be useful to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to caring for the Pemberley property .
He was highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , an intimate and confidential friend .
Mr. Darcy often recognized himself as the most obliging of my father's active supervision , and when , immediately before the death of my father , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise to support me , I am convinced that he greatly esteemed him a debt of gratitude to him , as of his affection for myself .  " 
" It's strange ! " 
exclaimed Elizabeth .
" How abominable !
I wonder that the pride of this Mr. Darcy did not do it just for you !
If it's not for a better reason , he should not have been too proud to be dishonest - for dishonesty I have to call him .  " 
" It's wonderful , "  replied Wickham ,  " for almost all his actions can be attributed to pride , and pride has often been his best friend .
It brought him closer to virtue than to any other feeling .
But we are none of us consistent , and in his behavior to me there were even stronger impulses than pride .  " 
" Such an abominable pride as she has already done him good ?
" Yes .
This has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give freely his money , to show hospitality , to help his tenants and to relieve the poor .
Family pride and sexual pride , because he is very proud of what his father did , did it .
Not to appear to dishonor his family , to degenerate popular qualities , or to lose the influence of Pemberley House , is a powerful motive .
He also has the pride of pride , which , with a certain fraternal affection , makes him a very kind and prudent guardian of his sister , and you will usually hear him crying as the most attentive and the best of brothers .
" What kind of girl is Miss Darcy ? " 
He shook his head .
" I wish I could call him kind .
It hurts me to speak badly of a Darcy .
But she looks too much like her brother - very , very proud .
As a child , she was affectionate and agreeable , and extremely affectionate to me; and I have spent hours and hours in his amusement .
But she is nothing to me now .
She is a beautiful girl , aged fifteen or sixteen , and I understand very well .
Since the death of her father , her house has been London , where a lady lives with her , and oversees her education .  " 
After many breaks and many essays on other subjects , Elizabeth could not help but go back to the first and say ,  " I'm amazed at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley !
How can Mr. Bingley , who looks good-humored , and who I really believe , really amiable , can he be friends with such a man ?
How can they correspond ?
Do you know Mr.
Bingley ?
" Not at all . " 
He is a gentle , kind , charming man .
He can not know what Mr. Darcy is .  " 
" Probably not , but Mr. Darcy can please where he wants .
He does not want abilities .
He can be a conversational companion if he thinks it is worth it .
Among those who are consequently his equals , he is a man very different from what he is for the less prosperous .
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich , he is liberal , just , sincere , rational , honorable , and perhaps pleasant - allowing something for fortune and figure .  " 
The whist game soon after the breakup , the players gathered around the other table and Mr. Collins took up his position between his cousin Elizabeth and Ms . Phillips .
The usual research on his success was made by the latter .
It had not been very good . he had lost all points; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern , he assured her with serious gravity that it was not of the slightest importance , that he regarded the money as a mere trifle , and begged her to surrender . not uncomfortable .
" I know very well , ma'am , "  he said ,  " that when people sit at a gaming table , they have to try their luck , and fortunately I am not in such circumstances that I can do five shillings .
There are probably many who can not say the same thing , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I have moved far beyond the need to take care of little things .
Mr. Wickham's attention was taken; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments , he whispered to Elizabeth if his relationship was very closely related to Bourgh's family .
" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , "  she replied ,  " has very recently given her life .
I hardly know how Mr. Collins was introduced to him for the first time , but he certainly has not known it for a long time .
" You know , of course , that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters , therefore she is an aunt at present .
Darcy .  " 
" No , indeed , I did not do it .
I did not know anything about Lady Catherine's relationship .
I have never heard of his existence until the day before yesterday .  " 
" Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . " 
This information made Elizabeth smile as she thought of poor Miss Bingley .
Vain must indeed be all his attentions , vain and useless his affection for his sister and his praise of himself , if he was already destined for others .
" Mr. Collins , she says , speaks highly of both Lady Catherine and her daughter , but from some of the details he has told , I suspect that his gratitude is deceiving him , and that , despite being his patron , she is an arrogant and vain woman .  " 
" I think it's both to a great extent , "  replied Wickham; I have not seen her for many years , but I remember very well that I never loved her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent .
She has a reputation for being remarkably sensitive and intelligent; but I think rather that she draws some of her abilities from her rank and fortune , partly from her authority , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that all who are in connection with him have a first class understanding .
Elizabeth hinted that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued to talk together , with mutual satisfaction until supper ended the cards , and gave the other ladies their share of the attentions of Mr. Wickham .  .
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips' dinner , but her manner recommended it to everyone .
All he said was well said; and all he did was gracefully done .
Elizabeth left with her head full of him .
She could only think of Mr. Wickham and what he had told her all the way home; but she did not even have time to pronounce his name , for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins remained silent .
Lydia kept talking about the lottery tickets , the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins , in describing the politeness of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips , protesting that he did not consider his losses in whist , listing all the dishes at supper , and dreading several times that he was encumbering his cousins , had more to to say that he could manage well before the car stopped at Longbourn House .
Chapter 17 Elizabeth reported to Jane the next day what had happened between Mr. Wickham and her .
Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she did not know how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's eyes; and yet it was not in his nature to question the veracity of a young man of such an amiable appearance as Wickham .
The possibility of having endured such malice was enough to interest all his tender feelings; nothing remained to be done , but to think of the two of them , to defend the conduct of each one , and to throw into the story of the accident or error what could not be explained otherwise .
" They both , "  she said ,  " have been deceived , I dare say , in one way or another , of which we can not form any idea .
Those interested may have misrepresented each other .
In short , it is impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances that may have alienated them , without there being any blame on both sides .
" Very true , indeed , and now , my dear Jane , what do you have to say on behalf of those interested who have probably dealt with the affair ?
Do it too , or we will have to think badly of someone .
Laugh as much as you want , but you will not laugh at my opinion .
My dear Lizzy , consider what a shameful light Mr. Darcy treats his father's favorite , the one his father promised to provide .
It's impossible .
No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it .
Can his most intimate friends be so disappointed in him ?
Oh !
not . " 
" I can believe much more easily that Mr. Bingley was taxed , that Mr. Wickham should invent a story of himself as he gave me last night , names , facts , all that is mentioned without ceremony .
If not , let Mr. Darcy contradict him .
Besides , there was truth in his looks .  " 
" It's difficult indeed - it's painful .
We do not know what to think .  " 
I beg your pardon , we know exactly what to think .
But Jane could think with certainty on one point - that Mr. Bingley , if it had been imposed , would have much to suffer when the matter became public .
The two young ladies were called from the grove , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had spoken; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-awaited ball in Netherfield , which was set for the following Tuesday .
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend , called her an age since they had met , and they repeatedly asked her what she had been doing since their separation .
For the rest of the family , they paid little attention; avoiding as much as possible Mrs. Bennet , saying little to Elizabeth , and nothing to the others .
They were soon gone , getting up from their seats with an activity that took their brother by surprise , and hurrying as if eager to escape Mrs. Bennet's courtesies .
The prospect of the Netherfield Ball was extremely pleasing to every woman in the family .
Ms . Bennet chose to consider this as a compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving Mr. Bingley's invitation himself , instead of a ceremonial card .
Jane imagined herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and in the attention of their brother; and Elizabeth was happy to dance a lot with Mr. Wickham , and to see a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behavior .
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on a single event , or a particular person , because even though everyone , like Elizabeth , wanted to dance half of the evening with Mr. Wickham , he was not the only one partner who could satisfy them and a ball was , in any case , a ball .
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no reluctance to that .
" As long as I can have my mornings for myself , "  she says ,  " it's enough - I think it's not a sacrifice to occasionally join the evening commitments .
Society has rights over us all; and I declare myself one of those who consider the intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everyone .
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion that , although she did not speak often unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , she could not help but ask him if he intended to accept the invitation of Mr. Bingley , and if he thought he could participate in the amusement of the evening; and she was astonished to find that he had no qualms about this head , and that she was far from dreading a reprimand from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .
I am in no way of opinion , I assure you , that a bullet of this kind , given by a young man of character to respectable people , may have a bad tendency , and I am so far from objecting to the dance , I hope I can be honored by all my beautiful cousins ​​during the evening , and I take this opportunity to solicit yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the first two dances especially , trust my cousin Jane for to attribute it to the good cause , and not to disrespect it .
Elizabeth felt completely taken .
She had completely offered to be hired by Mr. Wickham for these same dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead !
his liveliness had never been worse .
However , there was no help for that .
Mr. Wickham's happiness and his were necessarily delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins' proposal accepted with the greatest possible grace .
She was not all the more pleased with her gallantry of the idea that she was suggesting something more .
It seemed to her at first that she had been chosen from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of the Hunsford parsonage , and for having helped to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
The idea soon attained conviction , as it observed its growing civilizations towards itself , and heard its frequent attempt of a compliment on its wit and liveliness; and , although more astonished than satisfied with this effect of her charms , her mother was not long in making her understand that the probability of their marriage was very agreeable to her love .
Elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the clue , being well aware that a serious fight must be the consequence of any response .
Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and until he did , it was useless to quarrel with him .
If there had not been a bullet from Netherfield to get ready and talk about , the young Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiful state at the moment , because from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once .
No aunt , no officer , no news could be sought - the same shoes for Netherfield were obtained by proxy .
Even Elizabeth could have found a try of his patience in time which totally suspended the improvement of his acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such an enduring Friday , Saturday , Sunday and Monday to Kitty and Lydia .
Chapter 18 Until Elizabeth entered the Netherfield drawing-room , and searched in vain for Mr. Wickham among the clusters of red coats that were assembled there , a doubt about his presence had never occurred to him .
The certainty of meeting him had not been verified by any of those memories that might not have alarmed him .
She had dressed more carefully than usual , and was preparing herself with the greatest joy for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued from her heart , hoping that it was not more than what could be won at home . during the evening .
But in an instant , the terrible suspicion of having been deliberately omitted for the pleasure of Mr. Darcy in the Bingley's invitation to the officers; and although it was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny , to whom Lydia applied with eagerness , and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town for business the day before .  , and had not yet returned; adding , with a significant smile ,  " I do not think his company would have called him right now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here . " 
That part of her intelligence , though not heard by Lydia , was caught by Elizabeth , and as she assured him that Darcy was no less responsible for Wickham's absence than if his first guess had been right , all The feeling of dissatisfaction with the former was so honed by an immediate disappointment that she could scarcely reply with sufficient politeness to polite inquiries which he then directly approached to do .
Assistance , indulgence , patience with Darcy , was an injury to Wickham .
She was determined not to have a conversation with him , and turned away with a sort of bad temper that she could not overcome even while talking to Mr. Bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her .
But Elizabeth was not trained for bad temper; and although every prospect of hers was destroyed for the evening , she could not remain long on her mind; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the quirks of her cousin , and to point it out to her special attention .
The first two dances , however , brought a return of distress; they are dances of mortification .
Mr. Collins , clumsy and solemn , apologizing instead of attending , and often moving badly without knowing it , gave him all the shame and misery that an unpleasant partner can give for two dances .
The moment of his release from him was ecstasy .
She then danced with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking about Wickham , and hearing that he was universally loved .
When these dances were over , she returned to Charlotte Lucas's house , and was in conversation with her , when she was suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy , who had so much surprised her by her request for her , that , without knowing what she was doing she accepted it .
He went away immediately , and she let herself be worried about her lack of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:  " I dare say that you will find it very pleasant .
" God forbid !
This would be the greatest misfortune of all !
Find a nice man that one is determined to hate !
Do not wish me such a bad thing .  " 
When the dance resumed , however , and Darcy approached to claim her hand , Charlotte could not help but warn her in a whisper , not to be a fool , and to make him believe that Wickham made her unpleasant . in the eyes of a man . its consequence .
Elizabeth did not answer , and took her place in the set , astonished at the dignity with which she had managed to find herself in front of M . Darcy , and to read in the looks of her neighbors , their astonishment to see him .
They remained for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence would last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it; until suddenly she imagines it would be a greater punishment for her partner to force her to speak , she made a slight observation on the dance .
He replied , and was silent again .
After a pause of a few minutes , she addressed him a second time:  " It's up to you to say something , Mr. Darcy .
I talked about dancing , and you should make some sort of remark about the size of the room or the number of couples .
He smiled and assured her that everything she wanted to say to him should be said .
" Very good .
This answer will do for the moment .
Maybe little by little I will observe that private balls are much more pleasant than public balls .
But now , we can be silent .
" Do you speak by rule , then , while you dance ? " 
" Sometimes .
You have to talk a little , you know .
It would be strange to be completely silent for half an hour together; and yet , for the benefit of someone , the conversation must be arranged in such a way that they have the trouble of saying as little as possible .
" Do you consult your own feelings in this case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " 
" Both , "  replied Elizabeth in an arched tone;  " because I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .
We are each of an unsociable disposition , taciturn , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that would surprise the whole play , and be transmitted to posterity with all the brilliance of a proverb .
" It's not a very striking resemblance to your own character , I'm sure , "  he says .
" Since he can be close to mine , I can not pretend to say .
You think it's a true portrait , no doubt .
" I do not have to decide on my own performance . " 
He did not answer , and they were silent again until they came down into the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not walk often to Meryton .
She replied in the affirmative and , unable to resist the temptation , added:  " When you met us there the other day , we had just formed a new acquaintance .
The effect was immediate .
A deeper shade of height covered his features , but he did not say a word , and Elizabeth , while blaming herself for her own weakness , could not continue .
At last Darcy spoke , and said in a constrained voice:  " Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners that can assure his friends , that he is also able to hold them back , less sure .
" He was so unlucky as to lose your friendship , "  replied Elizabeth emphatically ,  " and in a way that he is likely to suffer from all his life .
Darcy did not answer and seemed to want to change the subject .
At that moment , Sir William Lucas appeared near them , meaning to pass across the whole other side of the room; but when he saw Mr. Darcy , he stopped with a courtesy salute to compliment him on his dance and his partner .
" I was very gratified , my dear sir .
Such a very superior dance is not often seen .
It is obvious that you belong to the first circles .
Let me say , however , that your right partner does not dishonor you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Eliza (taking a look at her sister and Bingley ) will take place .
What congratulations will flock !
I appeal to Mr. Darcy: - but do not interrupt , sir .
You will not thank me for having kept you from the bewitching lusts of this young woman whose bright eyes reproach me too .
The last part of this address has hardly been heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him by force , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane , who were dancing together .
Recovering , however , soon , he turned to his partner , and said ,  " The interruption of Sir William made me forget what we were talking about . " 
" I do not think we're talking at all .
Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves .
We have already tried two or three topics without success , and what we need to talk about later , I can not imagine .  " 
" What do you think about books ? " 
he said smiling .
" Books - oh !
not .
I'm sure we never read the same thing , or not with the same feelings .  " 
I'm sorry you thought so , but if it does , there can be at least no subject .
We can compare our different opinions .  " 
" No , I can not talk about books in a ballroom , my head is always full of something else . " 
" The present always occupies you in such scenes , does not it ? " 
he said with a look of doubt .
" Yes , always , "  she replied , not knowing what she was saying , for her thoughts had moved away from the subject , when she suddenly appeared and she suddenly exclaimed:  " I remember hearing you say , Mr. Darcy , forgive you , that your resentment once created was unbearable .
You are very careful , I suppose , as to its being created .
" I am , "  he said firmly .
" And never let yourself be blinded by prejudices ? " 
" I hope not . " 
" It is especially the responsibility of those who never change their minds , to be sure to judge correctly at the beginning . " 
" Can I ask what are these questions ? " 
" Simply to illustrate your character , "  said she , trying to shake her gravity .
" I'm trying to get out of it . " 
" And what is your success ? " 
She shook her head .
" I do not get along at all .
I hear stories so different from you that I am extremely intrigued .
" I can easily believe , "  he gravely replied ,  " that the reports may vary considerably from me , and I might wish , Miss Bennet , that you should not sketch my character at the present moment , for there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on one or the other .  " 
" But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . " 
" I would not wish to suspend your pleasure , "  he replied coldly .
She said nothing , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied , but not to an equal degree , for in Darcy's chest there was a pretty powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all her anger against another .
They had not been separated for a long time , when Miss Bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:  " So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham !
Your sister told me about him and asked me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man has forgotten to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the steward of the late Mr. Darcy .
I recommend , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his affirmations; for as to M . Darcy employing him badly , it is perfectly false; for , on the contrary , he has always been remarkably kind to him , although George Wickham treated Mr. Darcy most infamously .
I do not know the details , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not guilty at all , that he can not bear to hear about George Wickham , and that even though my brother thought he could not not to avoid including him in his guest to the officers , he was exceedingly happy to see that he had withdrawn from the path .
His entry into the country is indeed a very insolent thing , and I wonder how he could afford to do it .
I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of the guilt of your favorite; but really , given its descent , we could not expect much better .  " 
" His guilt and descent appear by your account to be the same , "  said Elizabeth angrily; for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than being the son of the intendant of Mr. Darcy , and from that I can assure you that he has informed me himself .
" I beg your pardon , "  said Miss Bingley , turning around with a sneer .
" Excuse my interference - it was nice meant . " 
" Insolent girl ! " 
Elisabeth said to herself .
" You are very wrong if you intend to influence me by such a derisory attack .
I see nothing but your own willful ignorance and the wickedness of Mr.
Darcy .  " 
She then sought out her older sister , who had undertaken to learn about the same Bingley subject .
Jane met her with a smile of so sweet complacency , a glow of expression so happy , so marked to congratulate the satisfaction of the evening .
Elizabeth was instantly reading her feelings , and at that moment the solicitude for Wickham , the resentment against her enemies , and all the rest , gave way to Jane's hope of being the most just for happiness .
" I want to know , "  said she , with a no less smiling face than her sister ,  " what you have learned about Mr. Wickham .
But perhaps you have been too kindly engaged to think of a third person; In this case , you can be sure of my forgiveness .  " 
" No , "  said Jane ,  " I have not forgotten it , but I have nothing satisfactory to say to you .
Mr. Bingley does not know his whole story and does not know anything about the circumstances that have offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct , probity and honor of his friend , and he is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has received much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received . ; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man .
I am afraid he was very imprudent and deserves to lose Mr. Darcy's esteem .
" Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself ? " 
" No , he never saw her until the other morning in Meryton . " 
" This account is then what he received from Mr. Darcy .
I am satisfied .
But what does he say of the living ?
" He does not remember exactly the circumstances , although he has heard them more than once from Mr. Darcy , but he believes that it was left to him "  only  "  .
" I do not doubt Mr. Bingley's sincerity , "  said Elizabeth warmly;  " But you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .
Mr. Bingley's defense against his friend was very effective , I dare say; but since he does not know many parts of history , and has learned the rest of this friend himself , I will venture to think of the two gentlemen as before .
She then changed the speech into a more gratifying speech for everyone , and on which there could be no difference of feeling .
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , if modest , hopes that Jane entertained for the esteem of Mr. Bingley , and said all that was in his power to give him more confidence .
Elizabeth being joined by Mr. Bingley himself , Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whom she scarcely replied after the friendly friendship of her last companion , before Mr. Collins came to them , and told him with great exultation that he had been lucky enough to make a capital discovery .
" I discovered , "  he says ,  " in a singular accident , that there is now in the room a close relative of my employer .
It happened to me to hear the gentleman himself mention to the girl who does the honors of the house the names of her cousin Miss de Bourgh and her mother Lady Catherine .
How wonderfully this kind of things happen !
Who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly !
I am very grateful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects , what I am going to do now , and I hope he will excuse me for not having done so before .
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apologies .  " 
" You will not report to Mr.
Darcy !  " 
" Indeed I am .
I'll apologize for not doing it sooner .
I believe him as Lady Catherine's nephew .
It will be in my power to assure him that his Lordship went well last night .
Elizabeth endeavored to dissuade him from such a project , assuring him that M . Darcy would consider that he was addressing him without introduction as an impertinent liberty , rather than as a compliment to his aunt; that it was not the least necessary , there should be an opinion on each side; and that if it did , it was up to Mr. Darcy , the superior accordingly , to begin the knowledge .
Mr. Collins listened with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she stopped speaking she replied ,  " My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion of the world in your excellent judgment . on all matters of the scope of your understanding , but let me say that there must be a great difference between the ceremonies established among the laity and those that govern the clergy , because let me observe that I consider the clerical ministry as equal to dignity point with the highest rank in the kingdom - provided that a good humility of behavior is at the same time maintained .
You must therefore allow me to follow the orders of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to accomplish what I consider a duty .
Forgive me for not taking advantage of your advice , which on all other subjects will be my constant guide , although in this case I consider myself more apt by education and the usual study to decide what is just a young woman like you .  " 
And , with a feeble bow , he left her to attack M . Darcy , whose avowals she eagerly awaited , and whose astonishment to be so addressed was very evident .
Her cousin preferred her speech with a solemn greeting , and even though she could not hear a word , she felt like she heard all that and saw in the movement of her lips the words  " apology , "   " Hunsford , "  and  "  Lady Catherine . from Bourgh .  " 
It annoyed her to see him expose himself to such a man .
Mr. Darcy looked at him with frantic wonder , and when finally Mr. Collins gave him time to speak , replied with a distant air of courtesy .
Mr. Collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and Mr. Darcy's contempt appeared to increase greatly with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he inclined it slightly , and moved his 'another way .
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth .
" I have no reason , I assure you , "  he said ,  " to be dissatisfied with my reception .
Mr. Darcy seemed very pleased with the attention .
He answered me with the greatest civility , and even complimented me on saying that he was so convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment that she was sure that she could never indignantly grant a favor .
It was really a beautiful thought .
Overall , I'm very happy with him .  " 
As Elizabeth had no further interest in pursuing , she turned almost entirely to her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections that her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane .
She saw her in idea to settle in that same house , in all the happiness that a marriage of true affection could give; and she felt capable , in such circumstances , of even trying to love Bingley's two sisters .
The thoughts of her mother , which she clearly saw , were curved in the same way , and she decided not to venture near her , for fear of hearing too much .
When they sat down to supper , she considered that it was a most unlucky perversity that placed them one in the other; and she was deeply upset that her mother spoke to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely , openly , and nothing but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley .
It was a lively subject , and Mrs. Bennet seemed unable to fatigue by listing the benefits of the match .
He was so charming and so young , and so alive three miles from them , that it was the first point of his own gratitude; and then it was so comforting to think how much the two sisters were fond of Jane , and to be certain that they wanted the link as much as she could .
It was , moreover , so promising a thing for her younger daughters , that Jane marrying so strongly must throw them in the path of other rich men; and finally , it was so agreeable in his time to be able to entrust his unmarried daughters to the care of their sister , so that she would not be obliged to go in company more than she wanted .
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find the comfort of staying home at any time in her life .
She concludes with much hope that Lady Lucas might soon be so lucky , though she evidently and triumphantly believed that there was no chance .
In vain did Elizabeth endeavor to verify the rapidity of her mother's words , or to persuade her to describe her happiness in a murmur less audible; for , to her inexpressible spite , she could perceive that the chief had been heard by Mr. Darcy , who was sitting in front of them .
Her mother only scolded her for being absurd .
" What is Mr. Darcy to me , I pray , that I should be afraid of him ?
I am sure that we owe him no particular civility to be obliged to say nothing , he does not like to hear .
" For the sake of heaven , ma'am , speak lower .
What advantage can it offer you to offend Mr. Darcy ?
You will never recommend yourself to his friend by doing so !  " 
However , nothing she could say had any influence .
His mother spoke of his views in the same intelligible tone .
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and spite .
She could not help but frequently look at Mr. Darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for although he did not always look at his mother , she was convinced that her attention was invariably fixed by her .
The expression on his face gradually changed from indignant contempt to calm and calm gravity .
Finally , Mrs. Bennet had nothing more to say; and Lady Lucas , who had been yawning for a long time at the repetition of delights she did not see as likely to share , was left with the comfort of cold ham and chicken .
Elizabeth has now started to live again .
But little time was the interval of tranquility; for , at the end of supper , people were talking about songs , and she had the mortification of seeing Mary , after very few supplications , preparing to oblige the company .
By many significant looks and silent prayers , she tried to prevent such proof of complacency , but to no avail; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity to exhibit was charming , and she began her song .
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with the most painful sensations , and she watched her go through the various stanzas with an impatience which was very badly rewarded at their closing; for Marie , in receiving , among the thanks of the table , the suspicion of a hope that she might be favored to favor them further , after the half-minute break began another .
Mary's powers were by no means peculiar to such a deployment; his voice was weak and his manner affected .
Elizabeth was in anguish .
She looked at Jane to see how she was wearing it; but Jane spoke very calmly to Bingley .
She looked at her two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision , and Darcy , who continued , however , imperturbably grave .
She watched her father beg for his intervention , lest Mary would sing all night .
He took the advice , and when Mary had finished her second song , said aloud ,  " That will do extremely well , child .
You have delighted us long enough .
Let the other girls have time to exhibit .  " 
Mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father's speech , was afraid that her anxiety had done no good .
Other members of the party were now solicited .
" If I , "  said Mr. Collins ,  " so lucky to sing , I shall be very glad , I am sure , to oblige the company to take the air , for I regard music as a very innocent and perfectly compatible distraction . with the profession of clergyman .
I do not want to say , though , that we can be justified by spending too much time on music , because there are certainly other things to do .
The rector of a parish has a lot to do .
In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes that can be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his boss .
He must write his own sermons; and the time left will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , that he can not be dispensed from making as comfortable as possible .
And I do not think it is of the slightest importance that he should be attentive and conciliatory towards everyone , especially those to whom he owes his preference .
I can not discharge this duty; nor could I think of the man who should fail to show respect to anyone connected with the family .
And , saluting Mr. Darcy , he finished his speech , which had been uttered so loudly that he was heard in half the room .
Many watched - many smiled; but no one seemed more amused than Mr. Bennet himself , while his wife seriously congratulated Mr. Collins for having spoken so well , and observed in a low voice to Lady Lucas that he was a remarkably intelligent and good young man .  .
For Elisabeth , it appeared that if his family had agreed to expose themselves as much as possible during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their part with more wit or success; and , happy , she thought that Bingley and her sister had escaped him a part of the exhibition , and that his feelings were not of the same order as the madness he had to witness .
That her two sisters and Mr. Darcy , however , had such an opportunity to ridicule her relations , were bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable .
The rest of the evening brought him little amusement .
She was teased by Mr. Collins , who continued with more perseverance by his side , and although he could not prevail over her to dance with him again , put him out of his power to dance with them . other .
In vain did she beg her to get up with someone else , and offered to introduce him to any girl in the room .
He assured him that , to dance , he was perfectly indifferent to him; that her principal object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend herself to her , and that he was therefore bound to remain near her all evening .
There was no discussion on such a project .
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas , who often joined them , and kindly engaged in conversation with Mr. Collins .
She was at least free from the offense of the other opinion of Mr. Darcy; although often standing at a very short distance from her , quite disengaged , he could never get near enough to speak .
She thought that was the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham , and rejoiced in it .
The detachment at Longbourn was the last of all to leave , and , by a maneuver from Mrs. Bennet , he had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after the departure of everybody , which gave them time to see what good heart they were . wished far away by part of the family .
Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were obviously impatient to have the house for themselves .
They rejected any attempt at Mrs. Bennet's conversation , and in so doing cast a languor on the whole party , which was hardly relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins , who complimented Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness that had marked their behavior to their guests .
Darcy does not say anything .
Mr. Bennet , in equal silence , appreciated the scene .
Mr. Bingley and Jane stood together , a little detached from each other and talking to each other only .
Elizabeth maintained a silence as firm as Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too tired to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  " Lord , how tired I am !
accompanied by a violent yawn .
When they finally said goodbye , Mrs. Bennet was very urgent in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn , and especially addressed Mr. Bingley to assure him of his happiness by eating a family . dinner with them at any time without the formal invitation ceremony .
Bingley experienced the pleasure of gratitude , and willingly volunteered for the first opportunity to wait for him , after his return from London , where he was obliged to go the next day for a short time .
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied and left the house with the delicious persuasion that , in order to make the necessary preparations for the establishments , the new cars and the wedding clothes , she would undoubtedly have her daughter settle in Netherfield in three or four months .  .
To have another daughter married to Mr. Collins , she thought with the same certainty and considerable pleasure , though not equal .
Elizabeth was the least expensive of all her children; and although the man and the match were good enough for her , the value of each was overshadowed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield .
Chapter 19 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn .
Mr. Collins made his statement in form .
Having resolved to do so without loss of time , his leave being extended until the following Saturday , and having no feeling of mistrust of himself for the moment , he began to in a very orderly manner , with all the observances , that he supposed a regular part of the affair .
Meeting up with Mrs. Bennet , Elizabeth , and one of the youngest girls , shortly after lunch , he said to the mother ,  " May I hope , Madam , for your interest in your daughter Elizabeth when I ask for honor ? a private audience with her in the morning ?
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a flush of surprise , Mrs. Bennet immediately replied ,  " Oh my God - yes - certainly .
I'm sure Lizzy will be very happy - I'm sure she can not have any objection .
Come on , Kitty , I want you on the stairs .
And , gathering her work together , she hurried away , when Elizabeth shouted ,  " Madam , do not leave .
I beg you , you will not leave .
Mr. Collins must apologize .
He can not tell me that no one needs to hear .
I'm leaving myself .  " 
" No , no , nonsense , Lizzy .
I want you to stay where you are .  " 
And when Elizabeth really appeared , with annoyed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added ,  " Lizzy , I insist on your stay and your audience .
Collins .  " 
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction - and a moment of reflection making her as sensitive as it would be wiser to finish it as quickly and discreetly as possible , she sat down and tried to hide , by a job incessant , the feelings that were divided between distress and misappropriation .
Ms . Bennet and Kitty left , and as soon as they left , Mr. Collins started .
Believe me , my dear Mademoiselle Elizabeth , that your modesty , far from doing you any harm , rather adds to your other perfections .
You would have been less friendly to me if there had not been this little repugnance; but let me assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address .
You can hardly doubt the meaning of my speech , yet your natural delicacy may lead you to dissimulate; my attentions were too marked to deceive me .
Almost as soon as I entered the house , I distinguished you as the companion of my future life .
But before I run away with my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be appropriate for me to explain my reasons for getting married - and , moreover , to enter Hertfordshire with the intention of choosing a woman , as I certainly did it .  " 
The idea of ​​Mr. Collins , with all his solemn calm , being carried away by his feelings , made Elizabeth so close to laughter , that she could not use the short pause that he allowed him to try to stop him more . and he continued: My reasons for marriage are , first of all , that I think it is good for any clergyman in easy circumstances (like me) to give the example of marriage in his parish , after which I am convinced that it will add much to my happiness; and thirdly , what I should perhaps have mentioned earlier is the particular counsel and recommendation of the most noble lady whom I have the honor to call patroness .
Twice she deigned to give me her opinion (unsolicited too !)
about this topic; and it was only on the Saturday evening before I left Hunsford - between our quadrille pools , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's stool , that she said , 'Mr.
Collins , you have to get married .
A clergyman like you must get married .
Choose well , choose a sweet woman for my love; and for your sake , let her be a kind of active , useful , not high , but able to make a small income go a good way .
This is my advice .
Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I'll visit her .
Permit me to observe , my dear cousin , that I do not reckon the opinion and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as one of the least advantages I can offer .
You will find his ways beyond all that I can describe; and your spirit and your vivacity , I think , must be agreeable to her , especially when she is tempered by the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite .
So much for my general intention in favor of marriage; it remains to be said why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighborhood , where I can assure you that there are many kind young women .
But the fact is that since I am heir to this estate after the death of your honored father (who can however live many more years) , I could not be satisfied without deciding to choose a woman from among his daughters . that the loss for them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place - which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years .
That was my motive , my beautiful cousin , and I flatter myself that I do not let myself fall into your esteem .
And now it remains for me to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection .
For fortune , I am perfectly indifferent , and I will not make any request of this nature to your father , since I am well aware that it could not be respected; and that a thousand pounds in the four per cent , which will belong to you only after the death of your mother , is all that you will be entitled to .
On this head , therefore , I will be uniformly silent; and you can make sure that no ungenerous reproach will ever pass my lips when we are married .  " 
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now .
" You are too hasty , sir , "  she cried .
" You forget that I did not answer .
Let me do it without further loss of time .
Accept my thanks for the compliment you pay me .
I am very sensitive to the honor of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to refuse them .
" I'm not learning , "  Mr. Collins said formally ,  " that it's common for young girls to reject the addresses of the man they secretly want to accept , when he asks for the first time , and sometimes the refusal is repeated for a second or even a third time .
I am not at all discouraged by what you have just said , and I hope I can lead you to the altar soon .
" On my faith , sir , "  cried Elizabeth ,  " your hope is a little extraordinary after my declaration .
I assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such ladies) who dare to risk their happiness on the possibility of being invited a second time .
I am perfectly serious in my refusal .
You could not make me happy , and I'm sure I'm the last woman in the world who could do this to you .
No , if your friend Catherine knew me , I am sure she would find me in all respects poorly qualified for the situation .
" Was it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , "  Collins said very gravely -  " but I can not imagine that his ladyship would disapprove of you at all .
And you can be certain when I have the honor of seeing her again , I will speak in the highest terms of your modesty , your economy , and your other kind qualities .
" Indeed , Mr. Collins , all the praise from me will be useless .
You must let me judge myself and give me the compliment to believe what I say .
I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do everything in my power to prevent you from being otherwise .
In making the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings towards my family , and take possession of the estate of Longbourn every time it falls , without any reproach .
This case can therefore be considered as definitely settled .  " 
And rising as she spoke , she would have left the room , if Mr. Collins had not so addressed:  " When I will do myself the honor to speak to you later on the subject , I hope to receive a more favorable response that you . Now , I am far from accusing you of cruelty , because I know it is the established custom of your sex to reject a man from the first application , and perhaps you have already said so much to encourage my costume as would consistent with the true delicacy of the female character .  " 
" Really , Mr. Collins , "  cried Elizabeth , with a touch of warmth ,  " you make me a great enigma .
If what I have said so far can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I do not know how to express my refusal so as to convince you that it is one .
" You must allow me to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is only words , of course .
My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not seem to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer is not highly desirable .
My situation in life , my relations with Bourgh's family and my relationship with yours are circumstances that are very favorable to me; and you should consider further , that despite your multiple attractions , there is no certainty that another marriage offer can ever be made to you .
Your portion is unfortunately so small that it will probably cancel the effects of your beauty and your kind qualifications .
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I will choose to attribute it to your desire to increase my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant women .
I assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man .
I would rather be paid the compliment of being sincerely believed .
I thank you again and again for the honor you have done in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible .
My feelings in all respects forbid it .
Can I speak more clearly ?
Do not consider me now as an elegant woman , intending to torment you , but as a rational creature , telling the truth of her heart .  " 
" You are uniformly charming ! " 
he exclaimed with an air of clumsy gallantry;  " and I am convinced that , when they are sanctioned by the express authority of your two excellent parents , my proposals will not fail to be acceptable . " 
At such perseverance in deliberate self-deception Elizabeth did not answer , and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined , if he continued to consider his repeated refusals as a flattering encouragement , to address his father , whose negative could be pronounced so as to be decisive , and whose behavior could not at least be confused with the assignment and the coquetry of an elegant woman .
Chapter 20 Mr. Collins had not been silent for a long time in contemplation of his successful love; Mrs. Bennet , having dragged herself into the vestibule to watch the end of the conference , did not see any sooner that Elizabeth opened the door and , with a quick step , made her go down the stairs , as she entered the room . breakfast and congratulated her . herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their closer rapprochement .
Mr. Collins received and congratulated them with equal pleasure , and then began to relate the details of their interview , with the result of which he had confidence that he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which he had Constantly given his cousin was naturally derived from his timid modesty and the true delicacy of his character .
This information , however , surprised Mrs. Bennet; she would have been happy to be equally pleased that her daughter would have liked to encourage her by protesting against her proposals , but she dared not believe it and could not refrain from saying so .
" But , depend on it , Mr. Collins , "  she added ,  " let Lizzy be brought to his senses .
I will talk to him directly .
She is a very stubborn , stupid girl , and does not know her own interest , but I will let her know .  " 
" Forgive me for interrupting you , madame , "  cried Mr. Collins;  " But if she is really stubborn and stupid , I do not know if she would be quite a very desirable woman to a man in my situation , who naturally seeks happiness in the marriage state .
If , therefore , she persists in rejecting my costume , perhaps it is better not to force her to accept me , for if she is capable of such defects of character , she could not contribute much to my happiness .
" Sir , you misunderstand me , "  said Mrs. Bennet , alarmed .
" Lizzy is stubborn only in these areas .
In all the rest , she is as good a girl as ever lived .
I'll go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we'll deal with him very soon , I'm sure .
She did not give him time to answer , but hurrying to see her husband , shouting as she entered the library ,  " Oh !
Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately; we are all in a tumult .
You must come and marry Mr. Collins , because she promises not to have him , and if you do not hurry , he will change his mind and can not get it .
Mr. Bennet looked up from his book as he entered , and fixed them on his face with a calm carefreeness which was by no means affected by his communication .
" I do not have the pleasure of understanding you , "  he said , when she had finished her speech .
" What are you talking about ? " 
From Mr. Collins and Lizzy .
Lizzy says she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins starts saying he will not have Lizzy .  " 
" And what should I do on occasion ?
It seems a desperate business .  " 
Talk to Lizzy yourself .
Tell him you want to marry him .
" Let her be called .
She will hear my opinion .  " 
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell , and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library .
" Come here , my child , "  cried his father , appearing .
" I sent you for a matter of importance .
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage .
Is it true ? " 
Elizabeth replied that it was .
" Very good - and this wedding offer you refused ? " 
" I have , sir . " 
" Very good .
We come now to the point .
Your mother insists on your acceptance .
Is it not , madame ?
Bennet ?  " 
" Yes , or I will never see her again . " 
" An unfortunate alternative is in front of you , Elizabeth .
From this day , you must be a stranger to one of your parents .
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .
Elizabeth could only smile at such a conclusion from such a beginning , but Mrs. Bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband was considering the matter as she wished , was exceedingly disappointed .
" What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , speaking this way ?
You promised me to insist on marrying her .
" My dear , "  replied her husband ,  " I have two little favors to ask .
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on this occasion; and on the other hand , from my room .
I will be happy to have the library for me as soon as possible .
However , not yet , despite her disappointment with her husband , Ms . Bennet gave up the point .
She spoke to Elizabeth again and again; cajoled and threatened him in turn .
She tried to assure Jane of his interest; but Jane , with all possible sweetness , refused to interfere; and Elizabeth , sometimes with a real seriousness , and sometimes with a cheerful gaiety , responded to her attacks .
Although his manners have varied , however , his determination has never done .
Meanwhile , Mr. Collins meditated in solitude over what had happened .
He thought too well of himself to understand what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered no other way .
Her respect for her was totally imaginary; and the possibility that she deserved her mother's reproach prevented her from regretting .
While the family was in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them .
She was greeted in the vestibule by Lydia , who , flying towards her , exclaimed in a low voice:  " I am glad you came , because there is so much pleasure here !
What do you think happened this morning ?
Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not get it .  " 
Charlotte barely had time to answer , before being joined by Kitty , who came to tell him the same thing; As soon as they entered the breakfast room , where Mrs. Bennet was alone , she also began to talk about Miss Lucas's compassion and begged her to persuade her friend Lizzy to submit to the wishes of all her family . family .
" Pray , my dear Miss Lucas , "  she added , in a melancholy tone ,  " for no one is on my side , no one takes part in me .
I am cruelly used , no one feels for my poor nerves .  " 
Charlotte's response was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth .
" Yes , she is coming , "  continued Mrs. Bennet , looking as indifferent as possible , and not caring more about us than if we were in York , as long as she could have her own way .
But I'm telling you , Miss Lizzy - if you put your head into continuing to refuse any marriage offer that way , you'll never get a husband - and I'm sure I do not know who should maintain you when your father is dead .
I will not be able to keep you - and so I warn you .
I did it with you from now on .
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .
I have no pleasure talking to unpleasant children .
I do not have much pleasure talking to anyone .
People who suffer from nervous complaints may not be inclined to speak .
Nobody can say what I'm suffering !
But it's still the case .
Those who do not complain are never pitied .  " 
Her daughters listened silently to this outpouring , aware that any attempt to reason with her or appease her would only aggravate the irritation .
So she spoke without interruption of one of them , until Mr. Collins , who entered the room with a more majestic air than usual , joined her and , seeing who she said , to the girls: insist that you all speak and that Mr. Collins and I have a little conversation together .
Elizabeth walked quietly out of the room , Jane and Kitty followed , but Lydia remained standing , determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte , first restrained by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after her and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , contented herself with walking towards the window and pretending not to hear .
In a sad voice , Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation:  " Oh !
M .
Collins !  " 
" My dear madam , "  he replied ,  " let us be always silent on this point .
Far be it from me ,  " he continued in a voice that showed his dissatisfaction , "  to complain about your daughter's behavior .
Resignation to the inevitable evils is our duty to all; the special duty of a young man who was as lucky as I was in my first assignments; and I think I'm resigned .
Perhaps not less to feel a doubt about my positive happiness if my beautiful cousin had honored me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never as perfect as when the blessing refused begins to lose some of its value in our estimate .
I hope you will not regard me as a disrespect to your family , my dear madam , thus withdrawing my pretensions to the favor of your daughter , without having paid you , and to Mr. Bennet , the compliment of you ask for your authority in name .
My conduct may , I fear , be reprehensible for having accepted my disgrace from your daughter's lips instead of yours .
But we are all likely to mistake .
I certainly meant well through the whole affair .
My goal has been to assure you a kind companion , taking into account the benefit of your whole family , and if my boss was at all objectionable , I apologize here .
Chapter 21 The discussion of Mr. Collins' offer was now almost over , and Elizabeth had only to suffer the uncomfortable feelings that were necessarily accompanying her , and sometimes some piquant allusions from her mother .
As for the gentleman himself , his feelings were mainly expressed , not by embarrassment or despondency , nor by the attempt to avoid him , but by the stiffness of manners and the spiteful silence .
He hardly ever spoke to him , and the attentive attentions he had for him were transferred for the remainder of the day to Mlle . Lucas , whose civility in listening to him was a seasonal relief for all , and especially for his friend .  .
The next day did not diminish Mrs. Bennet's bad temper or bad health .
Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride .
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not seem the least affected by him .
He always had to leave on Saturday , and on Saturday he wanted to stay .
After breakfast , the girls went to Meryton to ask if Mr. Wickham had been fired and to complain about his absence from the Netherfield Ball .
He rejoined them as they entered the city , and accompanied them to their aunt , where their regrets and vexations , and the anxiety of everyone , were well discussed .
However , to Elizabeth , he voluntarily recognized that the necessity of his absence had imposed itself .
" I found , "  he said ,  " that the time was nearing that I'd better not meet Mr. Darcy , than to be in the same room , the same company with him for so many hours together , could be more that I could bear and that the scenes could become unpleasant to more of myself .  " 
She highly approved her indulgence , and they had the leisure to discuss it thoroughly , and for all the congratulations they gave themselves civilly , while Wickham and another officer accompanied them to Longbourn , and during the march he took care especially of his .
His accompaniment was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment she offered herself , and it was the most suitable to introduce her father and mother .
Shortly after their return , a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it's from Netherfield .
The envelope contained an elegant paper sheet , small , pressed hot , well covered with a blonde and fluid hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's face change by reading it , and saw her living intensely in particular passages .
Jane soon recovered herself , and , dismissing the letter , tried to join her usual gaiety in the general conversation; but Elizabeth was anxious about the subject , which robbed even Wickham's attention; and as soon as he had taken leave of him and his companion , a glance from Jane invited him to follow her .
When they had won their own room , Jane , taking the letter , said ,  " This comes from Caroline Bingley , what it contained surprised me a lot .
The whole troop left Netherfield at that time and headed for the city , without intending to return .
You will hear what she says .  " 
She then read the first sentence aloud , which included information of their just resolve to follow their brother directly to town , and their sense of having dinner on Grosvenor Street , where Mr. Hurst had a home .
The following was in these words:  " I do not claim to regret all that I will leave in Hertfordshire , except your company , my dearest friend , but we hope , in a future period , to enjoy many returns from these delicious relationships . that we have known and , during this time , can alleviate the pain of separation by a very frequent and unreserved correspondence .
I'm counting on you for that .  " 
To these great expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of mistrust; and although the suddenness of their distance surprised her , she saw nothing truly deplorable there; it should not be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley from being there; and as for the loss of their society , she was persuaded that Jane had to stop looking at her in the enjoyment of hers .
" It's unlucky , "  she said , after a short pause ,  " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country .
But can we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley is approaching may come sooner than she thinks , and that the pleasant relations you have known as friends will be renewed with still more satisfaction as What sisters ?
Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them .  " 
" Caroline is definitely saying that no one will come back to Hertfordshire this winter .
I read it to you:  " When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the affair which brought him to London could be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain that it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles arrives in town , he will not be in a hurry to leave , we have decided to follow him , so that he is not obliged to spend his money . vacant hours in a hotel without comfort .
Many of my acquaintances are already here for the winter; I wish I heard that you , my dear friend , intend to be part of the crowd , but from that I despair .
I sincerely hope that your Christmas holidays in Hertfordshire will be filled with festivities that this season usually brings , and that your births will be so numerous that they will prevent you from feeling the loss of the three we will deprive you of .
" It's obvious by that , "  added Jane ,  " that he does not come back this winter anymore . " 
" It's only obvious that Miss Bingley does not mean he should be . " 
" Why do you think ?
It must be his own doing .
He is his own master .
But you do not know all .
I will read you the passage that particularly hurts me .
I will not have any reservations about you .
Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are hardly less eager to see her again .
I really do not think that Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance and achievements; and the affection she inspires for Louisa and myself is increased in something even more interesting , the hope that we dare to hear from her being thereafter our sister .
I do not know if I have already spoken to you about my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without entrusting them , and I hope you will not consider them unreasonable .
My brother already admires him a lot; he will often have occasion now to see her on the most intimate foot; his relations all want the same thing as his; and the partiality of a sister does not deceive me , I believe , when I call Charles the most capable of engaging the heart of any woman .
With all these circumstances to favor an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dear Jane , to let me hope for an event that will ensure the happiness of so many ?
- What do you think of this sentence , my dear Lizzy ?
Jane said as she finished .
" Is not it clear enough ?
Does she not expressly state that Caroline neither expects nor wants me to be her sister ? that she is perfectly convinced of the indifference of her brother; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means (more gently !)
to put myself on my guard ?
Can there be another opinion on the subject ?
" Yes , there is , because mine is totally different .
Do you want to hear it ?  " 
" The most willing . " 
You will have it in a few words .
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy .
She follows him to the city hoping to keep him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you .
Jane shook her head .
" Indeed , Jane , you should believe me .
No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection .
Miss Bingley , I'm sure , can not .
It is not so simple .
Could she have seen half less love for Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes .
But the case is this: we are not rich enough or big enough for them; and she is all the more eager to obtain Mademoiselle Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been a marriage , she may have less difficulty in reaching a second; in which there is certainly ingenuity , and I dare say that it would succeed , if Mlle . de Bourgh was out of the way .
But , my dear Jane , you can not seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you that her brother admires Miss Darcy a lot , he is to a lesser degree less sensitive to your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or it will be in his power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he loves his friend very much .
" If we thought so of Miss Bingley , "  answered Jane ,  " your representation of all this could make me very easy .
But I know that the foundation is unfair .
Caroline is incapable of deliberately deceiving anyone; and all I can hope for in this case is that she is mistaken herself .
" That is true .
You could not have started a happier idea , since you will not console yourself in mine .
Believe it deceived , by all means .
You have now done your homework by her , and do not worry anymore .
" But , my dear sister , may I be happy , supposing even the best , by accepting a man whose sisters and friends wish him all to marry elsewhere ?
" You must decide for yourself , "  said Elizabeth; and if , after mature deliberation , you find that the misery of dishonoring your two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being your wife , I advise you by all means to refuse it .
" How can you speak that way ? " 
Jane said , smiling slightly .
" You must know that although I should be extremely distressed at their disapproval , I could not hesitate . " 
" I did not think you would , and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . " 
" But if he does not come back this winter , my choice will never be required .
A thousand things can happen in six months !
The thought that he was no longer coming back Elizabeth treated with the greatest contempt .
She seemed to him only the suggestion of Caroline's interested desires , and she could not suppose for a moment that these vows , so openly or skilfully spoken , could influence a young man so completely independent of everybody .
She represented to her sister , as well as possible , what she felt about it , and soon had the pleasure of seeing its happy effect .
Jane's mood was not discouraged , and she was gradually led to hope , though mistrust of affection sometimes overcame hope , that Bingley would return to Netherfield and respond to every wish of his heart .
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet would not hear of the departure of the family without worrying about the man's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of anxiety , and she lamented that the ladies had to leave when they became so intimate .
After regretting it , however , she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would soon be back and dine at Longbourn soon , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable statement , that although he was invited only to a family dinner she would take care of having two full courses .
Chapter 22 The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the day's leader was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins .
Elizabeth takes the opportunity to thank her .
" It keeps him in a good mood , "  she said ,  " and I am more obliged to you than I can express it .
Charlotte assured her friend that she was pleased to be useful , and that she would repay her for the small sacrifice of her time .
It was very kind , but Charlotte's kindness extended further than Elizabeth had any idea of; his aim was nothing more than to prevent him from going back to Mr. Collins's addresses , by engaging them against himself .
Such was the project of Miss Lucas; and appearances were so favorable , that when they separated at night , she would have felt almost sure of success had it not been for leaving Hertfordshire so soon .
But here she did an injustice to the fire and independence of her character , for that led her to escape from Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness , and to rush to Lucas Lodge to throw herself at her feet .
He wished to avoid the advice of his cousins , persuaded that if they saw him leave , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he did not want to know the attack before knowing its success; for though feeling almost sure and right , for Charlotte had been rather encouraging , he had been relatively timid since the adventure of Wednesday .
His reception , however , was the most flattering kind .
Miss Lucas saw him through the top window as he made his way to the house , and immediately went to meet him accidentally in the alley .
But few had dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited him there .
In a short time , as Collins's long speeches permitted , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house , he urged him to name the day which was to render him the happiest of men; and although such solicitation must be lifted for the present , the lady had no inclination to play with her happiness .
The stupidity with which he was favored by nature was to prevent his grace from all charm which might render a woman eager for her continuation; and Mademoiselle Lucas , who accepted it only by the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared little about when this establishment would be won .
Sir William and Lady Lucas were quickly solicited for their consent; and he was given with the most joyful eagerness .
The present circumstances of Mr. Collins made it a most suitable match for their daughter , to whom they could give little chance; and his prospects for future wealth were extremely accurate .
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the subject had ever excited , how many more years Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William advised that whenever Mr. Collins was in possession of the estate of Longbourn , it would be very opportune for him and his wife to make their appearance at St . James .
In short , the whole family was really thrilled on occasion .
The girls hoped to go out a year or two earlier than they could have done; and the boys were relieved of their apprehension of Charlotte dying an old maid .
Charlotte herself was pretty calm .
She had gained her point of view , and had time to take it into account .
His reflections were generally satisfactory .
Mr. Collins , to be sure , was neither reasonable nor agreeable; his society was boring and his attachment to her had to be imaginary .
But still he would be her husband .
Without thinking too much of men or of marriage , marriage had always been its object; it was the only disposition for educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain it may be to give happiness , it must be their best condom of want .
This condom she had now got; and , at twenty-seven , without ever being beautiful , she felt all the luck .
The least pleasant circumstance in the affair was the surprise that Elizabeth Bennet had to give her , whose friendship she appreciated beyond any other person .
Elizabeth would wonder , and probably blame her; and although his resolution was not shaken , his feelings were to be hurt by such disapprobation .
She resolved to give her the information herself , and consequently charged Mr. Collins , when he returned to Longbourn for dinner , not to leave any trace of what had happened before the whole family .
Certainly a promise of secrecy was well given , but it could not be held without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth into so direct questions on his return , that it took a little ingenuity to escape , and at the same time exercised a great self-denial , for he was anxious to publish his prosperous love .
As he was to start his journey too early the next day to see the whole family , the holiday ceremony was completed when the ladies settled for the night; and Mrs. Bennet , with much politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him again at Longbourn , whenever his engagements might permit him to visit them .
" My dear madam , "  he answered ,  " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because that is what I hoped to receive , and you can be sure that I will use it as soon as possible .
They were all astonished; and M . Bennet , who could not at all wish for such a quick return , said at once:  " But is there not danger of disapprobation of Lady Catherine , my good sir ?
You'd better neglect your relationship than risk offending your boss .
" My dear sir , "  replied Mr. Collins ,  " I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly prudence , and you can expect that I will not take such a material step without Madame's assistance .
" You can not be too on your guard .
Risk everything rather than dissatisfaction; and if you find him likely to be resurrected by returning home , which I would find excessively probable , stay quietly at home , and be convinced that we will not offend you .
" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention , and you will soon receive a letter of thanks and all the other marks of your esteem during my stay in Hertfordshire .
As for my beautiful cousins , although my absence is not long enough to make it necessary , I will take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , without exception to my cousin Elizabeth .
With good civility , the ladies withdrew; all equally surprised that he was meditating a quick return .
Mrs. Bennet wanted to understand by this that he thought of paying his addresses to one of his youngest daughters , and Mary might have been persuaded to accept it .
She noted her abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in her reflections that often struck her , and although by no means as intelligent as herself , she thought that if he were encouraged to read and improve by such an example as his , he could to become a very pleasant companion .
But the next morning , all hopes of this kind were removed .
Miss Lucas called shortly after breakfast , and in a private conference with Elizabeth reported the event the day before .
The possibility that Mr. Collins thought he was in love with his friend had already been to Elizabeth in the last day or two; but that Charlotte might encourage her seemed almost as far as possible that she could encourage her herself , and her astonishment was therefore great enough to first overcome the limits of decorum , and she could not help her exclaim: Committed to Mr. Collins !
My dear Charlotte - impossible !
The constant face that Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story , has given way to a momentary confusion here by receiving so directly a reproach; however , as it was not more than she expected , she soon regained her composure and replied calmly:  " Why would you be surprised , my dear Eliza ?
Do you think it's incredible that Mr. Collins could get a good opinion of a woman , because he was not so happy to succeed with you ?
But Elizabeth had now remembered , and , making a strong effort for that , she could assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished him every happiness imaginable .
" I see how you feel , "  Charlotte said .
" You must be surprised , very surprised - so recently that Mr. Collins wanted to marry you .
But when you have had time to think about it , I hope you will be satisfied with what I did .
I'm not romantic , you know; I have never been .
I only ask for a comfortable house; and considering the character , connection , and situation in Mr. Collins's life , I am convinced that my chances of happiness with him are as just as most people can boast of entering the state of marriage .
Elizabeth quietly replied  " without a doubt " ; and after an awkward break , they returned to the rest of the family .
Charlotte did not stay much longer , and Elizabeth was left to reflect on what she had heard .
It took a long time for her to reconcile herself with the idea of ​​such an inappropriate match .
Mr. Collins' strangeness making two wedding offers in three days was nothing compared to his acceptance now .
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of marriage was not exactly hers , but she did not assume that it was possible that when she was called to action she would sacrifice any better feelings . to the advantage of the world .
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a very humiliating image !
And to the grief of a friend who dishonored herself and lost herself in her esteem , there was the sad conviction that it was impossible for this friend to be happy enough in the fate she had chosen .
Chapter 23 Elizabeth sat with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting that she was allowed to mention it , when Sir William Lucas himself , sent by his daughter , announced his commitment to the family .
With a lot of compliments to them , and a lot of self-gratitude on the prospect of a connection between houses , he unfolded the case - to an audience not only wondering , but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely confounded; and Lydia , still unguarded and often uncivil , exclaimed loudly ,  " Good God !
Sir William , how can you tell such a story ?
You do not know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ?
Nothing less than the complacency of a courtier could have endured without such treatment; but the good breeding of Sir William carried him through all this; and although he took leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most lenient courtesy .
Elizabeth , sensing that it was her responsibility to relieve him of such an unpleasant situation , came forward to confirm her story , mentioning that she had already heard of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavored to put an end to the exclamations of his mother and sisters by the fervent congratulations to Sir William , in which she was easily joined by Jane , and making a variety of remarks on the happiness which one could wait for the match , the excellent character of Mr. Collins and the decent distance from London's Hunsford .
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too mistress to say many things while Sir William remained; but he had scarcely left him when his feelings found a quick breath .
In the first place , she persisted in not believing in the whole question; secondly , she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been collected; thirdly , she hoped that they would never be happy together; and fourth , that the match could be broken .
Two inferences , however , were clearly deduced from the set: one , that Elizabeth was the true cause of evil; and the other that she herself had been a barbarian deceived by all; and on these two points it remained mainly during the rest of the day .
Nothing could comfort him and nothing could soothe him .
That day , she did not exhaust her resentment either .
A week passed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her , it was a month before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude , and many months had gone before she could forgive their daughter .
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much quieter on occasion , and , as he had done , he pronounced himself to be most agreeable; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that Charlotte Lucas , whom he used to think was reasonably reasonable , was as mad as his wife , and crazier than his daughter !
Jane confessed a little surprise of the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her ardent desire for their happiness; Elizabeth could not persuade her to consider it improbable .
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas , for Mr. Collins was only an ecclesiastic; and that did not affect them otherwise than as news to be spread to Meryton .
Lady Lucas could not be insensitive to triumph in order to be able to retort to Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a well-bred daughter; and she called Longbourn more often than usual to say how happy she was , though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and her malicious remarks might have been enough to drive away happiness .
Between Elisabeth and Charlotte there was a constraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; Elizabeth felt confident that no real trust could ever exist between them .
Her disappointment at Charlotte made her more affectionate for her sister , whom she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she became more anxious every day , as Bingley had now left for a week and nothing more has heard of his return .
Jane had sent Caroline a quick reply to her letter , and counted the days until she could reasonably hope to hear again .
The letter of thanks promised by Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude that could have aroused a stay of twelve months in the family .
After unloading his conscience on this subject , he began to tell them , with much exaltation , his happiness of having obtained the affection of their kind neighbor , Miss Lucas , then he explained that it was only for the purpose to enjoy his society . he had been so ready to conclude with their kind desire to see him again at Longbourn , where he hoped to be able to return on Monday evening; for Lady Catherine ,  " he added , "  approved his marriage so earnestly , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which , he thought , would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to appoint a wife . the happiest day of men .
Mr. Collins' return to Hertfordshire was no longer a pleasure for Mrs. Bennet .
On the contrary , she was willing to complain as much as her husband .
It was very strange that he came to Longbourn instead of Lucas Lodge; it was also very annoying and extremely annoying .
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and the lovers were of all the most unpleasant people .
Such were Mrs. Bennet's soft murmurs , and they yielded only to the greatest distress of Mr. Bingley's prolonged absence .
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject .
Day after day he disappeared , with no other announcement of him , than the report which had soon prevailed upon Meryton not to come to Netherfield all winter; a report which exasperated Mrs. Bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous lie .
Even Elizabeth was beginning to fear - not that Bingley was indifferent - but that her sisters would manage to drive him away .
Not wishing to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness , and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent it from occurring frequently .
The combined efforts of her two insensible sisters and her powerful friend , helped by the charms of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London , were perhaps too much , she feared , for the strength of her attachment .
As for Jane , her anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than Elizabeth , but all she felt she wanted to hide , and between her and Elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never mentioned .
But , as such delicacy did not hold her mother , an hour passed rarely when she did not speak of Bingley , did not express her impatience for his arrival , did not even require Jane to confess that if he did not return she would not believe herself very badly .
It took all the constant sweetness of Jane to endure these attacks with tolerable tranquility .
Mr. Collins returned most exactly on Monday night , but his reception at Longbourn was not as gracious as at his first presentation .
He was too happy , however , to need much attention; and fortunately for others , the work of love relieved them of much of his company .
The day-to-day leader was at Lucas Lodge's bedside , and sometimes he returned to Longbourn only in time to apologize for his absence before the family went to bed .
Mrs. Bennet was really in a pitiful state .
The mere mention of something about the match threw her into an agony of bad mood , and wherever she went , she was sure to hear him speak .
Miss Lucas's sight was odious to him .
Like her successor in this house , she considered it with a jealous horror .
Whenever Charlotte came to see them , she concluded that she was anticipating the hour of possession; and every time she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins , she was convinced that they were talking about the estate of Longbourn and that she had resolved to retire and leave her daughters from the house as soon as Mr. Bennet would be dead .
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband .
" Indeed , Mr. Bennet , "  she said ,  " it is very difficult to think that Charlotte Lucas is the mistress of this house , that I am forced to give her her place , and that I come and see her take her place there .  !  " 
" My dear , do not give in to such dark thoughts .
Let's hope for better things .
Let us state that I can be the survivor .  " 
It was not very comforting for Mrs. Bennet , so instead of answering , she continued as before .
" I can not stand to think that they should have this whole area .
If it was not for the implication , I should not worry about it .  " 
" What should not bother you ? " 
" I should not do anything at all . " 
" Be grateful that you are preserved from such a state of insensitivity . " 
" I can never be grateful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about involvement .
How could someone be aware of leading a succession of his own daughters , I can not understand; and all for Mr. Collins's sake too !
Why should he have it more than anyone else ?
" I leave it to you to determine , "  said Mr. Bennet .
Chapter 24 Miss Bingley's letter arrived and ended the doubt .
The first sentence gave the assurance that they were all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with regret that his brother had not had time to pay homage to his friends from Hertfordshire before leaving the country .
Hope was finished , entirely finished; and when Jane was able to take care of the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the author , which could give him any comfort .
The praises of Miss Darcy occupied the chief .
Caroline bragged happily about their growing intimacy and ventured to predict the fulfillment of the vows that had been unveiled in her previous letter .
She also wrote with great pleasure that her brother was an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house , and noted with delight some of his plans for new furniture .
Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the leader of all this , heard him in silent indignation .
His heart was divided between his sister's concern and resentment against all others .
At Caroline's assertion that her brother was partial to Miss Darcy , she paid no credit .
That he really loved Jane , she did not doubt more than she had done; and , as she had always wished to love her , she could not think without anger , almost without contempt , of this facility of humor , of that want of resolution which now made him the slave of her friends , and led him to sacrifice of one's own happiness at the whim of their inclination .
However , if his own happiness had been the only sacrifice , he could have been allowed to do the sport in the way he felt the best , but his sister was involved because she thought he had to be sensitive himself .  .
It was a subject , on the whole , upon which reflection would be long-lasting , and which must have been useless .
She could not think of anything else; and yet if Bingley's esteem had really gone out , or was suppressed by the interference of his friends; if he had known of Jane's attachment , or if she had escaped her observation; However that may be , although his opinion of him was materially affected by the difference , the situation of his sister remained the same , his peace equally wounded .
A day or two passed before Jane had the courage to talk to Elizabeth about her feelings; but finally , after that Mrs. Bennet had left them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and her master , she could not help saying ,  " Oh , my dear mother had more power over herself !
She can have no idea of ​​the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .
But I will not pronounce myself .
It can not last long .
He will be forgotten and we will all be as before .
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .
" You doubt me , "  cried Jane , slightly dye; Indeed , you have no reason .
He can live in my memory as the most lovable man I know , but that's all .
I have nothing to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him for .
Thank God !
I do not have that pain .
A little time , so - I will definitely try to get better .
In a louder voice , she added soon:  " I have this comfort immediately , that it was only a mistake of fantasy on my side , and that it hurt no one but me -even .
" My dear Jane ! " 
cried Elizabeth ,  " you are too good .
Your sweetness and selflessness are truly angelic; I do not know what to tell you .
I have the impression that I have never done you justice or that I have never loved you as you deserve .
Miss Bennet eagerly renounced all extraordinary merit , and rejected the praises of her sister's affectionate affection .
" No , "  said Elizabeth ,  " it's not fair .
You want to believe that everyone is respectable , and that you are hurt if I speak badly of someone .
I only want to think that you are perfect , and you opposed it .
Do not be afraid to clash with excesses , to interfere with your privilege of universal benevolence .
You do not need .
There are few people I really like , let alone think about it .
The more I see the world , the more I am dissatisfied with that; and every day confirms my conviction of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the small dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or meaning .
I have recently met two cases , of which I will not speak; the other is Charlotte's wedding .
It's inexplicable !
In each view it is inexplicable !  " 
" My dear Lizzy , do not give in to such feelings .
They will ruin your happiness .
You do not make enough room for the difference of situation and temperament .
Consider the respectability of Mr. Collins and the constant and careful character of Charlotte .
Remember that she is part of a big family; as for fortune , it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe , for everyone's sake , that she may experience something similar and esteem for our cousin .
" To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could benefit from such a belief , because if I were convinced that Charlotte had some regard for him , I should think only more his understanding that now , make his heart .
My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a vain man , pompous , narrow-minded , and stupid; you know it as well as I do; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who married her can not have a good way of thinking .
You will not defend her , although it's Charlotte Lucas .
You must not , for a single individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor try to persuade or persuade you that selfishness is prudence , and the insensitivity of danger , the security of happiness .
" I must think that your language is too strong to speak of both , "  Jane answered .  " and I hope you will be convinced by seeing them happy together .
But enough of that .
You mentioned something else .
You mentioned two instances .
I can not misunderstand you , but I beg you , dear Lizzy , not to hurt me by thinking that this person is to blame , and to say that your opinion has fallen .
We must not be so ready to believe ourselves intentionally hurt .
One should not expect a vigorous young man to be ever so circumspect and cautious .
It is often only our own vanity that deceives us .
Women admire admiration means more than that .  " 
" And men take care that they should . " 
" If this is done deliberately , they can not be justified , but I have no idea that there is as much design in the world as some people imagine . " 
" I am far from attributing part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design , "  said Elizabeth; but without wishing to do evil , or to render unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .
The lack of reflection , the lack of attention to the feelings of others and the lack of resolution will do the trick .  " 
And do you attribute it to one or the other ?
" Yes , until the end .
But if I continue , I will displease you by saying what I think of the people whom you estimate .
Stop me as much as you can .
So you persist in assuming that his sisters influence him ?
" Yes , in conjunction with his friend . " 
" I can not believe it .
Why should they try to influence it ?
They can only wish for happiness; and if he is attached to me , no other woman can obtain it .  " 
" Your first position is wrong .
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish for its increase of wealth and consequence; they may want to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , good relationships and pride .
" No doubt they want him to choose Miss Darcy , "  said Jane;  " but that may be better feelings than you suppose .
They knew it much longer than they knew me; no wonder they like it better .
But , whatever their wishes , it is very unlikely that they opposed their brothers .
Which sister would think herself free to do it , unless there is something very reprehensible ?
If they thought he was attached to me , they would not try to separate us; if he were , they could not succeed .
Assuming such affection , you make everyone acting abnormally and badly , and I the most unfortunate .
Do not bother me with the idea .
I'm not ashamed of being wrong - or at least it's light , it's nothing compared to what I should feel when I think badly of him or his sisters .
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it can be understood .  " 
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from then on , Mr. Bingley's name was almost never mentioned between them .
Mrs. Bennet was still wondering and repenting on her return , and although a day rarely passed when Elizabeth did not realize it clearly , there was little chance she would ever consider her with less perplexity .
Her daughter tried to convince her that she did not believe herself , that her attentions for Jane had been only the effect of a vulgar and fleeting taste , which ceased when he no longer saw her; but although the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , it had the same story to repeat every day .
Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley had to come back down in the summer .
Mr. Bennet treated the question differently .
" So , Lizzy , "  he said one day ,  " your sister is in love , I think .
I congratulate her .
After being married , a girl likes to be crossed a little in love from time to time .
It's something to think about , and it gives him a kind of distinction among his companions .
When is your turn coming ?
You will not stand to be long surpassed by Jane .
Now is your time .
Here are enough officers in Meryton to disappoint all the girls in the country .
Let Wickham be your man .
He is a nice man , and you are credible .  " 
" Thank you , sir , but a less pleasant man would satisfy me .
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune .  " 
" It's true , "  said Mr. Bennet ,  " but it's comforting to think that something like this can happen to you; you have a loving mother who will make the most of it .
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service to dispel the sadness that the last perverse events had thrown upon much of Longbourn's family .
They saw him often , and his other recommendations were added to those of the general reserve .
All that Elizabeth had already heard , her claims about Mr. Darcy and all that he had suffered from him , were now openly acknowledged and publicly solicited; and everyone was happy to know how much they had always hated Mr. Darcy before they knew anything .
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose that there were extenuating circumstances in the affair , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; his gentle and constant candor always pleaded for compensation , and encouraged the possibility of errors - but by all the others , Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men .
Chapter 25 After a week spent in the professions of love and the projects of happiness , Mr. Collins was called by his kind Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday .
The pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his part , by preparations for the reception of his wife; as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his return to Hertfordshire , the day would be fixed to make him the happiest of men .
He took leave of his parents at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; once again wished his beautiful cousins ​​health and happiness , and promised their father another letter of thanks .
The following Monday , Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving his brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend Christmas in Longbourn .
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible man , a gentleman , far superior to his sister , as well by nature as by education .
The ladies of Netherfield would have had difficulty believing that a man who lived by trade , and at the sight of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and pleasant .
Mrs. Gardiner , who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips , was a kind , intelligent , and elegant woman , and a great favorite with all her nieces of Longbourn .
Especially between the two elders and herself , there remained a special glance .
They had often stayed with her in town .
The first part of Ms . Gardiner's case when she arrived was to hand out her presents and describe the latest fashions .
When that was done , she had a less active role to play .
It's his turn to listen .
Mrs. Bennet had many complaints to tell , and a lot to complain about .
They had all been badly used since the last time she had seen her sister .
Two of his daughters were about to get married , and after all there was nothing in it .
" I do not blame Jane , "  she continued ,  " because Jane would have had Mr. Bingley if she could .
But Lizzy !
Oh , my sister !
It is very difficult to think that she could have been Mr. Collins's wife at that time , if not for her own evil .
He made her an offer in the same room , and she refused .
The consequence is that Lady Lucas will have a married daughter before me , and that the estate of Longbourn is still so important .
Lucases are very skillful people indeed , my sister .
They are all for what they can get .
I'm sorry to say about them , but it's so .
It makes me very nervous and poor , so being thwarted in my own family , and having neighbors who think of themselves before everyone else .
However , your coming right at this moment is the greatest comfort , and I am very happy to hear what you are saying , long sleeves .  " 
Mrs. Gardiner , to whom the head of this news had been given previously , during the correspondence of Jane and Elizabeth with her , made a light answer to her sister , and , out of compassion to her nieces , turned the conversation  .
When she was alone with Elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more about the subject .
" It seems to have been a desirable match for Jane , "  she said .
" I'm sorry it's gone .
But these things happen so often !
A young man , as you describe Mr. Bingley , falls so easily in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when an accident separates them , forgets it so easily , that these sorts of inconsistencies are very frequent .
" An excellent consolation in his own way , "  said Elizabeth ,  " but she will not do for us .
We do not suffer from accident .
It does not often happen that the intervention of friends persuades a young man of independent fortune not to think about a girl whom he was violently in love a few days ago .
But this expression of  " violently in love "  is so banal , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea .
It is as often applied to feelings that spring from half an hour of knowledge as to a real and strong attachment .
Pray , how was Mr. Bingley's love violent ?
" I never saw a more promising inclination , he became completely inattentive to other people , and completely absorbed in it .
Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable .
At his own ball , he offended two or three girls by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer .
Could there be finer symptoms ?
Is not general incivility the very essence of love ?
Oh ! Yes ! From that kind of love that I suppose he has experienced .
Pauvre Jane !
I'm sorry for her , because with her disposition she may not be able to recover immediately .
It would have been better for you , Lizzy; you would have laughed earlier .
But do you think she would be able to come back with us ?
Scene change could be helpful - and maybe a little home relief could be as useful as anything .
Elizabeth was extremely pleased with this proposal and felt confident of her sister's assent .
" I hope , "  added Mrs. Gardiner ,  " that no consideration of this young man will influence him .
We live in such a different part of the city , all our relationships are so different and , as you know , we go out so little , that it is very unlikely that they will meet , unless it really comes see .  " 
" And that is quite impossible , for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy will no longer bear him to call Jane in a part of London ! " 
My dear aunt , how can you think about it ?
Mr. Darcy might have heard of Gracechurch Street , but he would not think enough about a month of ablution to purify him of his impurities , if he were to enter it once; and depend on it , Mr. Bingley never moves without him .
" So much the better .
I hope they will not meet at all .
But does not Jane correspond with her sister ?
She can not help you .  " 
" She will drop the knowledge entirely . " 
But in spite of the certainty that Elizabeth had had to put this point in evidence , as well as the fact that Bingley could no longer see Jane , even more interesting , she felt a solicitude on the subject that convinced her , on examination , she did not consider it completely hopeless .
It was possible , and sometimes she thought it likely , that her affection might be revived , and the influence of her friends successfully fought through the more natural influence of Jane's attractions .
Miss Bennet gladly accepted her aunt's invitation; and the Bingley did not have other thoughts at the same time , that , as she hoped , because Caroline did not live in the same house as her brother , she could from time to time spend a morning with her , without danger to see it .
The Guardians stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillips , the Lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without his betrothal .
Mrs. Bennet had so carefully planned for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they never sat at a family dinner .
When the engagement was for the house , some of the officers were still there - whose officers Mr. Wickham were sure to be one; and on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner , distrustful of Elizabeth's warm recommendation , observed them closely .
Without assuming , from what she saw , to be very much in love , their preference for each other was simple enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth about it before leaving Hertfordshire , and to represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such attachment .
For Mrs. Gardiner , Wickham had a way to provide pleasure , unrelated to his general powers .
About ten years ago , before her marriage , she had spent considerable time in that part of Derbyshire to which he belonged .
So they had a lot of knowledge in common; and though Wickham would have been little since the death of Darcy's father , he was still in his power to give him the fresher intelligence of his old friends than he had in the means of procuring himself .
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley and knew the late Mr. Darcy very well by his character .
Here , therefore , was an inexhaustible subject of speech .
Comparing her memory of Pemberley with the minute description that Wickham could give , and by paying tribute to the character of her late owner , she was delightful to himself and herself .
Having learned of Mr. Darcy's current treatment , she tried to remember the gentleman's well-known disposition when he was in complete agreement with her , and finally felt sure that he had heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy speak . in the old days . like a very proud and mean boy .
Chapter 26 Mrs. Gardiner's prudence towards Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given at the first favorable opportunity to speak to her alone; After telling her honestly what she was thinking , she continued:  " You are a sensible girl , Lizzy , to fall in love just because you are warned , and therefore I am not afraid to speak . openly .
Seriously , I would like you to be on your guard .
Do not involve yourself , do not commit yourself to engage in an affection that the lack of fortune would render so imprudent .
I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he should have , I would think you could not do better .
But as it is , you must not let your fancy run away with you .
You make sense , and we all expect you to use it .
Your father will depend on your resolution and good behavior , I am sure .
You must not disappoint your father .  " 
" My dear aunt , it's serious indeed . " 
" Yes , and I hope you commit to being serious as well . " 
" Well , then , you do not have to be under an alarm .
I will take care of myself and Mr. Wickham too .
He must not be in love with me if I can stop him .  " 
" Elizabeth , you're not serious now . " 
" I beg your pardon , I will try again .
For the moment I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; No , I certainly am not .
But he is , beyond all comparison , the most pleasant man I have ever seen - and if he becomes really attached to me - I think it will be better if he does not do it .
I see the imprudence of that .
Oh !
this abominable Mr. Darcy !
The opinion of my father about me gives me the greatest honor , and I would be miserable to lose it .
My father , however , is biased to Mr. Wickham .
In short , my dear aunt , I would be very sorry to be the means to make you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom deprived by the immediate lack of fortune to enter into engagement with each other , how can I promise to be Wiser than so many of my fellows ? or how should I even know that it would be the wisdom to resist ?
All I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry .
I will not be in a hurry to believe me his first object .
When I'm with him , I will not wish him .
In short , I will do my best .  " 
" Maybe it will be as good if you discourage him from coming here so often .
At least you should not remind your mother to invite her .
" As I did the other day , "  said Elizabeth with a knowing smile ,  " very true , it will be wise for me to abstain from thatt .
But do not imagine that he is always there so often .
It is on your account that he has been so often invited this week .
You know my mother's ideas about the need for a constant company for her friends .
But truly , and on my honor , I will try to do what I think is the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied .  " 
Her aunt assured her that she was , and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her allusions , they separated; a wonderful example of advice given on such a point , without being offended .
Mr. Collins returned to Hertfordshire shortly after he was left by the Guardians and Jane; but , settling in the Lucases , his arrival did not cause great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet .
Her marriage was fast approaching and she resigned herself so long to believe that it was inevitable , and even more than once , to say , in a cunning tone , that she  " wished to be happy . " 
Thursday was to be the day of the wedding , and on Wednesday Miss Lucas made her farewell visit; and when she got up to take leave , Elizabeth , ashamed of her mother's disagreeable and reluctant wishes , and sincerely affected , accompanied her out of the room .
Going down the stairs together , Charlotte says ,  " I'm counting on hearing you very often , Eliza .
" That you will certainly do it . " 
" And I have another favor to ask you .
Do you want to come see me ?
We will meet often , I hope , in Hertfordshire .
" I will not leave Kent for a while .
So promise me to come to Hunsford .
Elizabeth could not refuse , even though she expected little pleasure in the visit .
" My dad and Maria come to see me in March , "  said Charlotte ,  " and I hope you'll agree to be there .
Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcomed as one or the other .  " 
The marriage took place; the bride and groom left for Kent at the door of the church , and everyone had as much to say or hear on the subject as usual .
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that he should be equally unqualified was impossible .
Elizabeth could never approach her without feeling that all the comforts of intimacy had passed , and although determined not to relax as a correspondent , it was for what had been , rather than what was .
The first letters of Charlotte were received with much eagerness; there could only be curiosity as to how she would speak of her new country , how she would like Lady Catherine , and how happy she would be to pronounce herself; however , when the letters were read , Elizabeth felt that Charlotte had expressed herself on every point exactly as she could have foreseen .
She wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded by all the comforts , and said nothing she could not praise .
The house , the furniture , the neighborhood and the roads were all to his taste , and Lady Catherine's behavior was very friendly and obliging .
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; Elizabeth realized that she had to wait for her own visit to know the rest .
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their arrival safely in London; and when she wrote again , Elizabeth hoped that it would be in her power to say something about the Bingleys .
His impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience in general .
Jane had spent a week in town without seeing or hearing Caroline .
She explained , however , assuming that her last letter to Longbourn had been lost by accident .
" My aunt , "  she went on ,  " will go to this part of the city tomorrow , and I will take the opportunity to call Grosvenor Street .
She wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen Miss Bingley .
" I did not think Caroline in spirit , "  she said to him ,  " but she was very glad to see me , and she reproached me for not having made any sign of her coming to London .
I was right , so my last letter had never reached him .
I inquired about their brother , of course .
He was fine , but he was so engaged with Mr. Darcy that they hardly ever saw him .
I thought Miss Darcy had dinner .
I wish I could see her .
My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were coming out .
I dare say that I will see them here soon .
Elizabeth shook her head above that letter .
She convinced him that the accident alone could tell Mr. Bingley that his sister was in town .
Four weeks have passed and Jane has seen nothing of him .
She tried to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention .
After waiting a fortnight at home every morning , and inventing a new excuse every evening for her , the visitor finally appeared; but the brevity of her stay , and even more the alteration of her manners , would no longer allow Jane to be mistaken .
The letter she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt .
My dear Lizzy will , I am sure , be unable to triumph in her best judgment , at my expense , when I confess to having been entirely deceived by Miss Bingley in my regard .
But , my dear sister , although the event has proved you well , do not believe me obstinate if I still affirm that , considering his behavior , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion .
I do not understand why she wants to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to be repeated , I am sure that I would be deceived again .
Caroline did not return my visit until yesterday; and not a note , not a line , have I received in the meantime .
When she came , it was very obvious that she had no pleasure; she made a slight and formal apology for not having called , did not say a word of wanting to see me again , and was in all respects so altered that a creature , when she went away , resolved not to continue the knowledge .  .
I'm sorry , although I can not help but blame her .
She was very wrong to distinguish me as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy has begun on his side .
But I pity her , because she must feel that she has done wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it .
I do not need to explain myself further; and although we know that this anxiety is utterly useless , however , if she feels it , she will easily give me an account of her behavior; and so dearly deserved as he is to his sister , any anxiety she must feel in her name is natural and amiable .
I can not help but wonder if she had such fears now , because if he had cared for me at all , we must have met a long time ago .
He knows I'm in town , I'm sure , from what she said herself; and yet it would seem , by her manner of speaking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy .
I do not understand it .
If I were not afraid to judge harshly , I would be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all of this .
But I will endeavor to banish all painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , of your affection , and of the inviolable goodness of my dear uncle and aunt .
Let me hear you soon .
Miss Bingley said something never to return to Netherfield , to leave the house , but without any certainty .
We better not mention it .
I am extremely pleased that you have such pleasant testimonies from our friends in Hunsford .
Pray to go see them , with Sir William and Maria .
I am sure you will be very comfortable there .
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but his spirits came back thinking that Jane would no longer be fooled , at least from the sister .
All the brother's expectations were now completely over .
She would not even want a renewal of her attentions .
His character has flowed on every review of it; and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible benefit to Jane , she seriously hoped that he could soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister , as by Wickham's account , she would make him regret what he had discarded .
Mrs. Gardiner at about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning this gentleman , and demanded information; and Elizabeth had to send as much as she could give to her aunt rather than herself .
His apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of someone else .
Elizabeth was vigilant enough to see everything , but she could see it and write it without material pain .
His heart had only been slightly touched , and his vanity was content to believe that his would have been his only choice , if fortune had allowed him .
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand livres was the most remarkable charm of the young woman to whom he now made himself agreeable; but Elizabeth , less lucid perhaps in this case than in that of Charlotte , did not quarrel with him for her desire for independence .
Nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural; and although she might suppose that it cost her some fights to abandon her , she was ready to allow her a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish her happiness .
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and having recounted the circumstances , she continued:  " I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been very in love , for if I had really experienced this pure and lofty passion , I would now hate her same name , and wish him every kind of evil .
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial to Miss King .
I can not know that I hate her at all , or that I am not at all willing to consider her a very good girl .
There can be no love in all this .
My vigilance has been effective; and although I am certainly a more interesting object for all my acquaintances if I were madly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance .
The importance can sometimes be bought too expensive .
Kitty and Lydia take her defection much more to heart than me .
They are young in the ways of the world , and are not yet open to the mortifying conviction that beautiful young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain .
Chapter 27 Without more events than those of the Longbourn family , and variously diversified beyond the walks in Meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , the months of January and February disappeared .
Mars was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford .
She had not at first thought seriously of going there; but Charlotte , she soon found , depended on the plan and gradually learned to consider it with more pleasure and greater certainty .
Absence had increased her desire to see Charlotte again and had weakened her dislike of Mr. Collins .
There was novelty in the project , and since , with such a mother and so incompatible sisters , the house could not be faultless , a small change was not unwelcome to itself .
The trip would give him a glance at Jane; and , in short , at the approach of time , she would have been very sorry for any delay .
However , everything went well , and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch .
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter .
The improvement of spending a night in London was added on time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be .
The only pain was to leave his father , who would certainly be missed , and who , when that had happened to him , loved him so little , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer his letter .
The farewell between her and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more .
Her present pursuit could not make her forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and deserve her attention , the first to listen to and pity her , the first to be admired; and in her manner of saying farewell to her , wishing her all the pleasures , reminding her of what she had to expect from Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and trusting their opinion - their opinion of everybody - would always coincide , he there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt she must never attach to him with a most sincere look; and she has separated from him convinced that , married or single , he must always be his model of the amiable and agreeable .
His traveling companions the next day were not likely to make him think that he was less agreeable .
Sir William Lucas , and his daughter Maria , a good-natured girl , but as empty as he , had nothing to say that could be worth listening to , and were listened with as much pleasure as the rattle of the chair long .
Elizabeth loved the nonsense , but she had known Sir William too long .
He could not tell him anything again of the marvels of his presentation and chivalry; and his civilities were worn out , like his information .
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles , and they started it so early to be in Gracechurch Street at noon .
As they went to Mr. Gardiner's door , Jane was at the window of a drawing-room watching their arrival; when they entered the corridor , she was there to welcome them , and Elizabeth , staring at her face , was happy to see her still so beautiful and healthy .
On the stairs , a troop of little boys and girls , whose impatience for the appearance of their cousin did not allow them to wait in the living room , and whose shyness , as we had not seen for a year , prevented them from going down .
Everything was joy and kindness .
The day passed most pleasantly; in the morning in the bustle and shopping , and in the evening in one of the theaters .
Elizabeth then arranged to sit by her aunt .
Their first object was his sister; and she was more distressed than surprised to hear , in answer to her minute questions , that although Jane had always struggled to support her mind , there were periods of despondency .
It was reasonable , however , to hope they would not last long .
Mrs. Gardiner also gave her the details of Miss Bingley's visit to Gracechurch Street , and repeated conversations at different times between Jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , abandoned knowledge .
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece to Wickham's desertion , and complimented her for having so well endured it .
" But my dear Elizabeth , "  she added ,  " what kind of girl is Miss King ?
I should be sorry to think of our mercenary friend .  " 
" Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial matters , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ?
Where does discretion end and where does avarice begin ?
On the last Christmas , you were afraid that he would marry me , because it would be imprudent; and now , because he's trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to know he's a mercenary .
If you only want to tell me what kind of girl Miss King is , I'll know what to think .
" She is a very good girl , I believe .
I do not know any harm of her .  " 
" But he did not pay any attention to her until her grandfather's death made her mistress of that fortune . " 
" No - why should he ?
If he was not allowed to win my affection because I did not have any money , what an opportunity it was to have sex with a girl he did not care about , and who was also poor .  ?
" But there seems to be an indelicacy in directing her attention to her so soon after this event . " 
" A man in distress does not have time for all these elegant decorations that others can observe .
If she does not object , why should we ?
" Not to object does not justify it .
It only shows that she is deficient in something herself - sense or feeling .  " 
Exclaimed Elizabeth , do it as you wish .
He will be mercenary , and she will be stupid .  " 
" No , Lizzy , that's what I do not choose .
I would be sorry , you know , to think of a young man who lived so long in Derbyshire .
" Oh !
if that's all , I have a very bad opinion of the young people who live in Derbyshire; and their close friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better .
I am sick of all .
Thank God !
I will go tomorrow where I will find a man who does not have a pleasant quality , who has neither way nor sense to recommend it .
Stupid men are the only ones who deserve to be known , after all .
" Take care , Lizzy , this speech savored a lot of disappointment . " 
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt on a tour of pleasure that they proposed to take in the summer .
" We have not figured out how far he will carry us , "  Gardiner said ,  " but , perhaps , to the Lakes . " 
No plan could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was the most ready and grateful .
- Oh ! My dear aunt , exclaimed she , with delight , what delight !
what happiness !
You give me a new life and vigor .
Farewell to disappointment and misses .
What are the young men with rocks and mountains ?
Oh !
what transport times we will spend !
And when we come back , it will not be like other travelers , without being able to give a precise idea of ​​anything .
We will know where we went , we will remember what we saw .
Lakes , mountains and rivers should not be confused in our imaginations; when we attempt to describe a particular scene , we will begin to quarrel over its relative situation .
Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travelers .
Chapter 28 Each object of the next day's voyage was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and his minds were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister so well that she banished all fear for her health , and the prospect of her tour in the north was a constant source of delights .
When they left the high road for the way to Hunsford , all eyes were in search of the presbytery , and every turn planned to put it in sight .
The palisades at Rosings Park were their limit on one side .
Elizabeth smiled at the memory of all she had heard from her people .
Finally the presbytery was discernible .
The garden sloping towards the road , the house that stood there , the green blades and the laurel hedge , all announced that they were coming .
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door , and the car stopped at the little door that led by a short walk of gravel to the house , among the nods and smiles of the whole party .
In an instant , they were all out of the chair , rejoicing at the sight of each other .
Mrs. Collins greeted her friend with the greatest pleasure , and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied to come when she was so affectionately welcomed .
She saw at once that her cousin's morals were not affected by her marriage; his formal civility was just what he had been , and he held her for a few minutes at the door to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all his family .
They were then , without further delay , to indicate the sharpness of the entrance , taken in the house; and as soon as they were in the parlor , he received them a second time , with an ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all the offers of refreshment of his wife .
Elizabeth was ready to see him in his glory; and she could not help but believe that by showing the right proportion of the room , its appearance , and its furniture , it was particularly directed to her , as if to make her feel what she had lost in refusing it .
But though everything seemed clear and comfortable , she could not give him any sighs of repentance , and looked with wonder at her friend that she could look so gay with such a companion .
When Mr. Collins said something his wife might reasonably be ashamed of , which was certainly not a coincidence , she involuntarily turned her gaze on Charlotte .
Once or twice , she could discern a slight blush; but , in general , Charlotte did not hear well .
After sitting long enough to admire all the furniture in the room , from the buffet to the wing , to give an account of their trip , and all that had happened in London , Mr. Collins invited them to walk around in the garden . who was tall and well disposed , and to the culture of which he cared himself .
To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the mastery of the countenance with which Charlotte spoke of the health of exercise , and she believed him encouraged as much as possible .
Here , guiding every walk and every walk , and leaving them little interval to express the praises he demanded , all the looks were pointed out with a meticulousness which left all the beauty behind them .
He could number the fields in all directions , and could tell how many trees were in the farthest bunch .
But of all the views that his garden , or that the country or the kingdom could boast , none was to be compared to the prospect of Rosings , allowed by an opening in the trees that bordered the park almost vis-à-vis his House .
It was a beautiful modern building , well located on a sloping ground .
From his garden , Mr. Collins would have led them around his two meadows; but the ladies , having no shoes to meet the remains of a white gel , turned round; and while Sir William accompanied him , Charlotte took her sister and friend to the house , extremely happy , probably , to have the opportunity to show it without the help of her husband .
It was rather small , but well built and practical; and everything was arranged and arranged with a sharpness and consistency that Elizabeth gave Charlotte all credit .
When we could forget Mr. Collins , there was really a great comfort , and because of the obvious joy of Charlotte , Elizabeth supposed that he must be often forgotten .
She had already learned that Lady Catherine was still in the country .
They talked about it again while they were at dinner , when Mr. Collins joined , and said ,  " Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honor of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh the following Sunday at church , and I do not I do not need to tell you will be delighted with it .
She is all affability and condescension , and I have no doubt , but you will be honored with part of her notification when the service is over .
I have almost no hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in all the invitations with which she honors us during your stay here .
His behavior towards my dear Charlotte is charming .
We dine in Rosings twice a week , and we are never allowed to go home .
His lady's car is regularly ordered for us .
I should say , one of his lady's cars , because she has several .
" Lady Catherine is indeed a very respectable , sensitive woman , "  added Charlotte ,  " and a very attentive neighbor . " 
" Very true , my dear , that's exactly what I'm saying .
She is the kind of woman that can not be considered with too much deference .
The evening was spent talking about Hertfordshire news and repeating what had already been written; and when it was closed , Elizabeth , in the solitude of her room , had to meditate on Charlotte's degree of contentment , understand her skill by guiding her husband , and remain calm with her , and recognize that everything was very well done .
She also had to guess how would spend her visit , the quiet tenuity of their usual jobs , the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins , and the likes of their relationship with Rosings .
A lively imagination soon arranged everything .
Toward the middle of the following day , while she was in her room preparing for a walk , a sudden noise seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and , after listening for a moment , she heard someone run down the stairs in a violent hurry and call loudly after her .
She opened the door and met Maria on the landing , who , panting with agitation , exclaimed:  " Oh ! My dear Eliza !
pray , hurry and enter the dining room , because there is such a sight to see !
I will not tell you what it is .
Hurry , and get off this moment .
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria did not want to tell him anything more , and they ran into the dining room , which looked out on the alley , in search of this marvel; They are two ladies who stop in a low phaeton at the garden gate .
" And that's all ? " 
exclaimed Elizabeth .
" I was expecting at least the pigs to enter the garden , and here is only Lady Catherine and her daughter . " 
" The !
my dear ,  " said Maria , shocked at the mistake , "  it is not Lady Catherine .
The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh .
Look at her .
She is a little creature .
Who would have thought she could be so thin and so small ?
" It's abominably rude to keep Charlotte out in all that wind .
Why does not she come ?
" Oh , Charlotte says she almost never does it .
This is the greatest of favors when Miss de Bourgh enters .  " 
" I like her appearance , "  said Elizabeth , struck with other ideas .
" She looks clumsy and crosses .
Yes , she will do very well for him .
She will make him a very good wife .  " 
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the door in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William , in the great diversion of Elizabeth , was stationed in the doorway , in the serious contemplation of greatness before him , and constantly bowing every time Mademoiselle de Bourgh looked that way .
Finally , there was nothing more to say; the ladies continued , and the others returned to the house .
Mr. Collins saw the two girls no sooner than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole evening was called to dinner at Rosings the next day .
Chapter 29 The triumph of Mr. Collins , following this invitation , was complete .
The power to show the greatness of his boss to his amazed visitors and to let them see his civility towards him and his wife , was exactly what he wanted; and that the opportunity of doing so should be given so early , was such an example of Madame Catherine's condescension , for he did not know how to admire enough .
" I confess , "  said he ,  " that I should not have been surprised to see that the princess asked us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings' house .
From my knowledge of his affability , I expected it to happen .
But who could have anticipated such attention ?
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation , by the way , including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival !  " 
" I am all the more surprised by what has happened , "  replied Sir William ,  " from that knowledge of what the mores of the great are really , which my situation in life has enabled me to acquire .
About the yard , such cases of elegant breeding are not uncommon .  " 
There was almost no talk of the whole day or the next morning , but of their visit to Rosings .
Mr. Collins instructed them with care what to expect , that the sight of such rooms , of so many servants , and of a splendid dinner , would not perhaps tame them completely .
When the ladies parted for the toilet , he said to Elizabeth ,  " Do not worry , my dear cousin , about your clothes .
Lady Catherine is far from demanding from us that elegance of dress which becomes herself and her daughter .
I would just advise you to put on your clothes something better than the rest - there is no occasion for anything else .
Lady Catherine will not think the worst of you being just dressed .
She likes to have the distinction of preserved rank .  " 
While they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to urge them to be quick , as Lady Catherine was anxious to wait for her dinner .
Such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her way of life , frightened Maria Lucas who had been unaccustomed to company , and she looked forward to her presentation in Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had made to her presentation . in St . James's .
As the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile through the park .
Each park has its beauty and its perspectives; and Elizabeth saw a lot to be satisfied , though she could not be in the raptures that Mr. Collins had expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of that That first , the glazing had cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh .
When they went up the stairs , Maria's alarm was increasing every moment , and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm .
Elisabeth's courage did not fail her .
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine , who spoke frightfully to her of extraordinary talents or miraculous virtues , and of the simple majesty of money or rank she thought she could testify without apprehension .
From the entrance , of which Mr. Collins remarked , with a delighted air , the fine proportion and the finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine , her daughter , and Mrs. Jenkinson was sitting .
His lordship , with great condescension , rose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had arranged with her husband that the office of introduction should be his , he was executed in a proper manner , without any of these excuses and thank you that he would have thought necessary .
Although he had been at St . James's , Sir William was so frightened by the greatness that surrounded him , that he had only the courage to bow low and to sit down without saying a word; and her daughter , almost frightened by her senses , sat down on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .
Elizabeth found herself quite up to the stage and could observe the three ladies in front of her .
Lady Catherine was a tall , tall woman , with strongly marked features , who might have been beautiful before .
His air was not conciliatory , and his manner of receiving them was not such as to make his visitors forget their lower rank .
It has not been made formidable by silence; but all she said was so authoritarian , which marked her own importance , and immediately brought Mr. Wickham into Elisabeth's mind; and according to the observation of the day altogether , she believed that Lady Catherine was exactly what he represented .
When , after having examined the mother , whose face and countenance she soon found some resemblance to Mr. Darcy , she turned her eyes to the girl , she could almost have joined Maria's astonishment , to be so thin and so small .
There was no figure or face of resemblance between the ladies .
Mademoiselle de Bourgh was pale and sickly; his features , although not simple , were insignificant; and she spoke very little , except in a whisper , to Mrs. Jenkinson , whose appearance was not remarkable , and who was fully occupied with listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the right direction in front of her . eyes .
After sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , Mr. Collins accompanying them to point out the beauties , and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was better to watch them in the summer .
The dinner was extremely fine , and there were all the servants and all the things that Mr. Collins had promised; and , as he had predicted , too , he sat down at the bottom of the table , by the desire of his wife , and gave the impression of feeling that life could furnish nothing greater .
He carved , and ate , and congratulated with delighted eagerness; and each dish was recommended , first by him , then by Sir William , who was now sufficiently recovered to echo all that his son-in-law said , in a manner that Elizabeth wondered if Lady Catherine could bear .
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave gracious smiles , especially when everything flat on the table seemed to them a novelty .
The party did not provide much conversation .
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was sitting between Charlotte and Mademoiselle de Bourgh - the first one was listening to Lady Catherine , and she did not say a word to her at dinner time .
Mrs. Jenkinson was mainly employed to watch how little Miss de Bourgh ate , urging her to try another dish , and fearing she was indisposed .
Maria thought it was out of the question , and the gentlemen were just eating and admiring .
When the ladies returned to the living room , there was little else to do than to hear Lady Catherine speak , which she did without interruption until the arrival of the cafe , giving her opinion on all subjects so decisively , proving that she was not used to seeing her judgment contradicted .
She inquired about Charlotte's domestic concerns , familiarly and thoroughly , gave her a lot of advice on the management of all; she tells him that everything must be settled in such a small family as his , and she instructed him on the care of his cows and his fowl .
Elizabeth found that nothing was below the attention of this great lady , who could give him the opportunity to dictate to others .
In the intervals of her speech with Mrs. Collins , she addressed a series of questions to Maria and Elizabeth , but especially to the last , connections of which she knew the least , and which she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very distinguished , pretty kind of girl .
She asked him , at different times , how many sisters she had , either older or younger than she , if any of them were likely to be married , if they were beautiful , where they had been educated , what car had his father , and what was his mother's maiden name ?
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very calmly .
Lady Catherine then observed:  " Your father's estate is related to Mr. Collins , I think .
For you , turning to Charlotte , I am happy; but if not , I see no opportunity to lead areas of the female lineage .
This was not deemed necessary in the family of Sir Lewis de Bourgh .
Are you playing and singing , Miss Bennet ?
" A little . " 
" Oh !
then - one day or another , we will be happy to hear you .
Our instrument is a capital instrument , probably greater than ---- You will try it one day .
Your sisters play and sing ?
" One of them does it . " 
" Why did not you all learn ?
You should all have learned .
The Miss Webbs all play , and their father does not have such a good income as yours .
Draw you ?  " 
" Not at all . " 
" What , none of you ? " 
" Not one . " 
" It's very strange .
But I guess you had no opportunity .
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of the masters .
" My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . " 
Did your housekeeper leave you ?
" We never had a housekeeper . " 
" No housekeeper !
How was that possible ?
Five girls raised at home without a governess !
I have never heard of such a thing .
Your mother must have been a slave to your education .  " 
Elizabeth could hardly help but smile , assuring him that this had not been the case .
" So who taught you ?
who assisted you ?
Without a housekeeper , you must have been neglected .  " 
" Compared to some families , I think we were , but those of us who wanted to learn never wanted the means .
We were always encouraged to read and had all the necessary teachers .
Those who chose to be idle , certainly could .  " 
" No doubt , but that is what a governess will warn , and if I had known your mother , I would have advised her to engage her with the greatest energy .
I always say that nothing should be done in education without regular and regular instruction , and no one but a governess can give it .
It's wonderful how many families I have been able to provide this way .
I am always happy to have a young person in a good position .
Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are very deliciously situated by my means; and it was only the other day that I recommended another young man , whom I was accidentally mentioned , and that the family is quite happy with her .
Ms . Collins , did I tell you yesterday about Lady Metcalf's call to thank me ?
She finds a treasure for Miss Pope .
" Lady Catherine , "  she said ,  " you have given me a treasure .
Has any of your younger sisters gone out , Miss Bennet ?
" Yes , ma'am , everything . " 
" All !
What , all five at once ?
Very strange !
And you only the second .
The youngest before the elders are married !
Your youngest sisters must be very young ?  " 
" Yes , my youngest is not sixteen .
Maybe the young person is full of youth to be in the company .
But really , ma'am , I think it would be very difficult for the young sisters , that they do not have their share of the society and the amusement , because the elder does not have the means or the envy to get married early .
The youngest child has as much right to the pleasures of youth as the first .
And to be remembered on such a motive !
I think it would not be very likely to promote fraternal affection or delicacy of mind .  " 
" On my word , "  said his ladyship ,  " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young person .
Pray , how old are you ?
" With three young sisters who grew up , "  said Elizabeth , smiling ,  " your Lordship can hardly expect me to possess it .
Lady Catherine seemed astonished at not receiving a direct answer; Elizabeth thought herself the first creature who would have dared to play with such dignified impertinence .
" You can not be over twenty , I'm sure , so you do not have to hide your age . " 
I'm not twenty-one .
When the gentlemen had joined them , and the tea was finished , the chart tables were placed .
Lady Catherine , Sir William , and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat at the quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play cassino , the two girls had the honor of helping Mrs. Jenkinson to party .
Their table was superlatively stupid .
There was hardly any syllable that did not relate to the game , except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears that Miss de Bourgh was too hot or too cold , or that she had too much or too little light .
Many more went to the other table .
Lady Catherine spoke in a general way - recounting the errors of the other three , or telling an anecdote of herself .
Mr. Collins was used to accepting everything his ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he had won , and apologizing if he thought he had won too much .
Sir William did not say much .
He stored his memory with anecdotes and noble names .
When Lady Catherine and her daughter played as long as they chose , the tables were broken , the car was offered to Mrs. Collins , gratefully accepted and immediately ordered .
The group then gathered around the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what time they should have the next day .
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thanks from Mr. Collins and as many bows on Sir William , they left .
As soon as they left the door , Elisabeth was called by her cousin to give her advice on all she had seen at Rosings , which , for Charlotte , made her more favorable than she actually was .  .
But his recommendation , though costing him some trouble , could in no way satisfy Mr. Collins , and he was soon obliged to take in hand the praise of his ladyship .
Chapter 30 Sir William stayed only a week in Hunsford , but his visit was long enough to convince him that his daughter was most comfortably settled and that she owned a husband and a neighbor who did not meet often .
While Sir William was with them , Mr. Collins spent his morning hunting him in his concert and showing him the country; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual occupations , and Elizabeth was grateful that they saw no more of her cousin through alteration , for the chief of time between lunch and dinner was now passed by him at work in the garden or reading and writing , and looking out the window in his own book-room , which directed the road .
The room in which the ladies were sitting was behind .
Elizabeth had at first rather asked herself that Charlotte should not prefer the dining room for common use; it was a better-sized room and had a nicer appearance; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she was doing , for Mr. Collins would doubtless have been much less in his apartment , had he been seated in an equally lively apartment; and she gave credit to Charlotte for the arrangement .
From the drawing-room they could make out nothing in the lane , and owed to M . Collins the knowledge of the cars that were going , and how often , especially , Miss de Bourgh passed in his phaeton , which he never failed to come to inform them  . of , although that happens almost every day .
She often stopped at the presbytery , and had a few minutes of conversation with Charlotte , but he was almost never to go out .
There were very few days when Mr. Collins did not go to Rosings , and a few days when his wife did not think it necessary to do the same; and until Elizabeth remembered that there might be other family lives to dispose of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .
From time to time they were honored with a call from him , and nothing escaped his observation that passed in the room during these visits .
She examined their jobs , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of furniture; or detected the cleaning lady in negligence; and if she accepted a refreshment , she seemed to do so only to discover that Mrs. Collins's meat joints were too big for her family .
Elizabeth soon perceived that , although this great lady was not committing the peace of the county , she was a very active magistrate in her own parish , whose slightest anxiety was borne by Mr. Collins; and whenever one of the vacationers was disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she went out into the village to settle their differences , to silence their complaints , and to reprimand them in harmony and abundance .
The entertainment of eating at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and , taking into account the loss of Sir William , and there was only one gaming table in the evening , each such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .
Their other commitments were few , because the lifestyle in the neighborhood in general was beyond the reach of Mr. Collins .
This , however , was not bad for Elizabeth , and overall she spent her time quite comfortably; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte , and the weather was so beautiful for the time of the year that she often had a lot of fun outdoors .
Her favorite walk , and where she often went while the others called Lady Catherine , was along the open grove that bordered that side of the park , where there was a pretty sheltered road , which no one seemed to enjoy , and where she felt out of reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity .
In this calm way , the first fortnight of his visit soon passed away .
Easter was approaching , and the week before it was to bring to Rosings an addition to the family which , in such a small circle , was to be important .
Elizabeth had heard shortly after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in a few weeks , and although there is not much of her knowledge that she did not prefer , her coming would provide a new relative to looking into their Rosings . She realized his behavior towards his cousin , to whom he was obviously destined by Lady Catherine , who spoke of his coming with the greatest satisfaction . of the highest admiration , and seemed almost sorry that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself .
His arrival was soon known at the presbytery; for Mr. Collins walked all morning at the sight of the lodges opening on Hunsford Lane , to have the first assurance of it , and , after bowing as the car turned into a park , he hastened to return home with great intelligence .
The next morning he hastened to greet Rosings .
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to exact them , for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a colonel Fitzwilliam , the youngest son of his uncle Lord ---- , and , to the great surprise of the whole party , when Mr. Collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him .
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately throwing herself into the other , told the girls what honor they could hope for , adding:  " Thank you , Eliza , for this courtesy .
Mr. Darcy would never have come so early to wait for me .
Elizabeth had scarcely time to get rid of the compliment , before the doorway announced their approach , and soon afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room .
Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way , was in his thirties , not good looking , but in person and really addressing the gentleman .
Mr. Darcy looked at him as he used to look in Hertfordshire - paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to Mrs. Collins , and whatever may be her feelings towards her friend , met her with a cold-blooded appearance .
Elizabeth simply bowed to her without saying a word .
Colonel Fitzwilliam enters directly into conversation with the promptitude and facility of a well-bred man , and speaks very agreeably; but her cousin , after giving Mrs. Collins a slight observation of the house and the garden , remained a moment without speaking to anyone .
In the end , however , her civility was so awake that she inquired of Elizabeth after the health of her family .
She answered him in the usual way , and after a pause , added:  " My older sister has been in town for three months .
Have not you ever seen her there ?
She was perfectly sensible that he had never had; but she wanted to see if he would betray the slightest awareness of what had happened between the Bingleys and Jane , and she thought he looked a little confused by replying that he had never had the chance to meet Miss Bennet .
The subject was no longer pursued , and soon the gentlemen went away .
Chapter 31 Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were greatly admired at the presbytery , and all the ladies felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings .
It took a few days before they were invited , for while there were visitors to the house , they could not be needed; and it was not until Easter , almost a week after the arrival of the gentlemen , that they were honored by such attention , and then they were simply asked to leave the church to come in there . evening .
For a week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter .
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called the parsonage more than once during this period , but Mr. Darcy had only seen them in church .
The invitation was of course accepted , and at a proper hour they entered Lady Catherine's salon .
His wife received them civilly , but it was clear that their company was not at all as acceptable as when it could have no one else; and she was , in fact , almost absorbed by her nephews , talking to them , especially to Darcy , much more than any other person in the room .
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really happy to see them; everything was a welcome relief at his home in Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend liked her imagination a lot .
He sat down next to her now , and spoke so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire , traveling and staying at home , new books and music , that Elizabeth had never been so amused in this room before; and they conversed with so much wit and movement , as to attract the attention of Lady Catherine herself , as well as of Mr. Darcy .
His eyes had been soon and several times turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that his wife , at the end of a moment , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to cry out ,  " What do you say , Fitzwilliam ?
What are you talking about ?
What do you say Miss Bennet ?
Let me hear what it is .
" We are talking about music , ma'am , "  he said , no longer able to avoid an answer .
" Of music !
So pray aloud .
It's all my pleasure .
I must have my part in the conversation if you are talking about music .
There are few people in England , I suppose , who have a greater pleasure in music than me , or a better natural taste .
If I had never learned , I should have been a great expert .
And Anne too , if her health had allowed her to apply .
I am confident she would have accomplished deliciously .
How is Georgiana , Darcy doing ?
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's skill .
" I am very happy to hear such a good account of her , "  said Lady Catherine; and ask her to tell her that she can not hope to excel if she does not do well .
" I assure you , madame , "  she replied ,  " she does not need such advice .
She practices very constantly .  " 
" So much the better .
This can not be done too much; and when I write to him , I will ask him to neglect nothing .
I often tell young girls that there is no musical excellence to acquire without constant practice .
I have told Miss Bennet several times that she will never play very well if she does not practice anymore; and although Mrs. Collins does not have an instrument , she is welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room .
She would not be in her place , you know , in this part of the house .
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed at his aunt's bad education , and did not answer .
When the coffee was over , Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth that she had promised to play him; and she sat directly at the instrument .
He drew a chair near her .
Lady Catherine listened to a half-song , then spoke , as before , to her other nephew; until this one moves away from her , and making with her habitual deliberation towards the pianoforte positioned in order to command a full view of the right artist's face .
Elizabeth saw what he was doing and , at the first convenient break , turned to him with an arched smile and said:  " You want to scare me , Mr. Darcy , by coming into all this state to hear me ?
I will not be alarmed although your sister does plays so well .
There is a stubbornness towards me that can never bear to be frightened by the will of others .
My courage always rises with every attempt at intimidation .  " 
" I will not say that you are mistaken , "  he replied ,  " because you could not really believe me capable of alarming you , and I had the pleasure of knowing long enough to know that you find great pleasure in professing from time to time . opinions that are not yours .
Elizabeth laughs heartily at this picture of herself , and says to Colonel Fitzwilliam:  " Your cousin will give you a very pretty idea of ​​me and teach you not to believe a word I say .
I am particularly unlucky to meet a person who is able to expose my true character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass with a certain degree of credit .
Indeed , Mr Darcy , it is very unhelpful of you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire - and , let me say it , very impolitic too - because it makes me retaliate , and such things can come out as shock your relationships to hear .  " 
" I'm not afraid of you , "  he said with a smile .
" Pray I hear what you have to accuse him of , "  exclaimed Colonel Fitzwilliam .
" I would like to know how he behaves among strangers . " 
" You'll hear then - but get ready for something very scary .
The first time I saw it in Hertfordshire , you have to know it was at the ball . And at this ball , what do you think he did ?
He danced only four dances , although the gentlemen were rare; and , to my knowledge , more than one young woman was sitting in need of a partner .
Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact .  " 
" I did not have the honor of knowing a lady of the assembly beyond my own party . " 
" True , and no one can ever be introduced to a ballroom .
Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what am I playing next ?
My fingers are waiting for your orders .  " 
" Perhaps , "  said Darcy ,  " I would have judged better if I had sought an introduction , but I am badly qualified to recommend myself to strangers .
" Are we going to ask your cousin why ? " 
said Elisabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam .
" Should we ask him why a man of sense and education , who has lived in the world , is badly qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?
" I can answer your question , "  Fitzwilliam said ,  " without applying to him .
It's because he will not bother .  " 
" I certainly do not have the talent that some people have , "  said Darcy ,  " to easily converse with those I have never seen before .
I can not catch the tone of their conversation , or seem interested in their concerns , as I often see them doing .  " 
" My fingers , "  said Elisabeth ,  " do not move on this instrument in the masterly manner that I see so many women .
They do not have the same strength or the same speed and do not produce the same expression .
But I always assumed it was my fault - because I would not bother to practice .
It's not that I do not think my fingers are as capable as any other woman of superior execution .
Darcy smiles and says ,  " You're absolutely right .
You have used your time much better .
No one admitted to having the privilege of hearing you , you can not believe it .
We are neither one nor the other in front of strangers .  " 
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine , who called to find out what they were talking about .
Elizabeth immediately started playing again .
Lady Catherine approached and , after listening for a few minutes , she said to Darcy ,  " Miss Bennet would not play at all if she practiced more and could have the advantage of a London master .
She has a very good notion of fingering , although her taste is not equal to that of Anne .
Anne would have been a delightful artist , if her health had allowed her to learn .  " 
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he approved the praises of his cousin; but neither at this moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from all her behavior to Miss de Bourgh she derived that comfort for Miss Bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her . , if it had been her relationship .
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance , mixing with them many instructions on performance and taste .
Elizabeth received them with all the courtesy , and , at the request of the gentlemen , remained at the instrument until the carriage of his wife was ready to take them home .
Chapter 32 Elizabeth was sitting alone the next morning , writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria went out to do business in the village , when she was surprised by a knock at the door , the sure signal of a visitor .
As she had heard no carriage , she thought that it would not be Lady Catherine , and , under this apprehension , she put away her half-finished letter to escape all the impertinent questions , when the door opened , and at her Surprisingly , Mr. Darcy and Mr. Darcy only entered the room .
He seemed astonished to find her alone , and apologized for his intrusion by letting him know that he had understood all the ladies who were going to be inside .
They then sat down , and when his inquiries after Rosings were made , they seemed in danger of sinking into total silence .
It was therefore absolutely necessary to think of something , and in this emergence remembering when she had seen it last in Hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say about their hasty departure , she observed: you all left Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy !
It must have been a very pleasant surprise for Mr. Bingley to see you so soon after him; because , if I remember correctly , he went there the day before .
He and his sisters were fine , I hope , when you left London ?
" Perfectly , thank you . " 
She realized that she would receive no further answer and , after a short pause , added:  " I think I understood that Mr. Bingley does not intend to return to Netherfield ?
I have never heard it said , but it is likely that it will spend very little time in the future .
He has many friends and he is at a time of life where friends and commitments are continually increasing .  " 
If he wants to be little in Netherfield , it would be better for the neighborhood to abandon the place altogether , because then we might be able to have a family there .
But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley has not taken the house as much for the convenience of the neighborhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep it or leave it on the same principle .
" I should not be surprised , "  Darcy said ,  " if he were to give up as soon as any qualifying purchase offer . " 
Elizabeth did not answer .
She was afraid to talk longer about her friend; and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to let her find a subject .
He took the clue , and soon began with ,  " It seems like a very comfortable home .
Lady Catherine , I believe , contributed a great deal when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford .
" I think she did it - and I'm sure she could not have been kind to a more grateful object . " 
" Mr. Collins seems to be very lucky in his choice of a woman . " 
" Yes , indeed , her friends may well be glad to have met one of the few reasonable women who would have accepted her , or would have made her happy if they had done so .
My friend has an excellent understanding - although I am not sure that I consider her the wisest wife of her marriage to Mr. Collins .
She seems perfectly happy , however , and under a prudential light , it's certainly a very good match for her .  " 
" It must be very nice for her to be at such an easy distance from her own family and friends . " 
" Easy distance , do you call ?
It's nearly fifty miles .
And what is fifty miles of good road ?
A little more than half a day of travel .
Yes , I call it an easy very distance .  " 
" I would never have considered distance as one of the benefits of the match , "  cried Elizabeth .
" I should never have said that Mrs. Collins was close to her family . " 
" This is proof of your attachment to Hertfordshire .
I suppose anything beyond Longbourn's neighborhood would appear far away .
Speaking , there was a kind of smile that Elizabeth thought she understood . he had to assume that she was thinking about Jane and Netherfield , and she blushed , replying ,  " I do not mean to say that a woman is not too close to her family .
The distant and the near must be relative and depend on many different circumstances .
Where there is wealth to make travel expenses insignificant , the distance becomes no harm .
But it is not the case here .
Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not one that allows for frequent travel - and I am sure my friend will not call himself  " close to his family "  at less than half the current distance .
Mr. Darcy moved a little closer to his chair and said ,  " You can not be entitled to such local attachment .
You have not always been to Longbourn .
Elizabeth seemed surprised .
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and glancing at it , said in a cold voice:  " Are you happy with Kent ?
A brief dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on each side calm and concise - and soon ended the entry of Charlotte and her sister , just back from her walk .
The head-to-head surprised them .
Mr. Darcy recounted the error which had caused his intrusion upon Mlle . Bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anyone , went away .
" What can be the meaning of this ? " 
said Charlotte , as soon as he was gone .
" My dear , Eliza , he must be in love with you , otherwise he would never have called us this familiar way . " 
But when Elizabeth spoke of her silence , it did not seem very likely , even according to Charlotte's wishes , that this was the case; and , after various conjectures , they could only suppose that his visit came from the difficulty of finding something to do , which was all the more probable at the time of the year .
All field sports were over .
Inside , there was Lady Catherine , books and a pool table , but gentlemen can not always be inside; and in the vicinity of the parsonage , or the pleasure of the walk to it , or the people who lived in it , the two cousins ​​found a temptation of this period to walk there almost every day .
They called at various hours in the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and from time to time accompanied by their aunt .
It was clear to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam was coming because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion that recommended him much more; and Elizabeth was recalled by her own satisfaction at being with him , as well as by her evident admiration of herself , of her former favorite George Wickham; and yet , when comparing them , she saw that there was less captivating sweetness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners , she believed that he might have the best informed mind .
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the presbytery , it was harder to understand .
It could not be for society , because he often stayed there for ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he spoke , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than choice - a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure for himself .
He rarely seemed really lively .
Mrs. Collins did not know what to do with him .
Colonel Fitzwilliam sometimes laughed at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which his own knowledge of him could not have told him; and as she would have liked to believe in this change the effect of love , and the object of her love , her friend Eliza , she set to work seriously to find out .
She looked at him every time they were in Rosings and every time he came to Hunsford; but without much success .
He certainly looked at his friend a lot , but the expression of that look was debatable .
It was a serious and firm look , but she often doubted whether there was much admiration , and sometimes it seemed nothing but a lack of wit .
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of being biased , but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it necessary to insist on the subject , of the danger of arousing hopes which could only lead to disappointment; for , in her opinion , she no doubt admitted that all the repugnance of her friend would disappear if she could believe that he was in his power .
In her kind projects for Elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marriage with Colonel Fitzwilliam .
He was beyond comparison the most agreeable man; he certainly admired him , and his situation in life was the most eligible; but , to counterbalance these advantages , Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none .
Chapter 33 Elizabeth , on her walk in the park , unexpectedly met Mr. Darcy .
She felt all the perversity of the bad luck that would bring him where no one else had taken him , and , to prevent it from happening again , took care to warn him first that it was his favorite place .
How could this happen a second time , so , was very strange !
Yet he did it , and even a third .
It was like deliberate ill-will , or voluntary penance , because on those occasions it was not just a matter of formal questions and an awkward pause , but he thought it was necessary to turn around and walk with her .
He never spoke much , and she did not bother to talk or listen a lot; but it seemed to him during their third meeting that he was asking strange and unrelated questions - about his pleasure in being at Hunsford , his love of solitary walks , and his opinion of the happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Collins; and that , speaking of Rosings , and not understanding the house perfectly , he seemed to expect that each time she returned to Kent , she would stay there too .
His words seemed to implicate him .
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts ?
She supposed , if he wanted to say something , he must mean an allusion to what might happen in this neighborhood .
It disturbed her a little , and she was very happy to be at the door of the blades in front of the presbytery .
She was betrothed one day , going through Jane's last letter , and lingering over some passages that proved that Jane had not written in mind , when , instead of being surprised again by Mr. Darcy , she saw looking up , Colonel Fitzwilliam met her .
Putting the letter back immediately and forcing a smile , she said ,  " I did not know before you ever walked that way . " 
" I visited the park , "  he replied ,  " as I usually do every year , and I intend to close it by a telephone call to the presbytery .
Do you go much further ?
" No , I should have gone in a moment . " 
And as a result , she turned , and they walked together to the presbytery .
" Are you sure to leave Kent on Saturday ? " 
she says .
" Yes - if Darcy does not postpone it .
But I am at his disposal .
He arranges the business as he pleases .  " 
" And if he is not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice .
I do not know anyone who seems more appreciative of the power to do what he likes than Mr.
Darcy .  " 
" He likes to have his own way very well , "  replied Colonel Fitzwilliam .
" But we all do it .
It is only that he has better ways of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor .
I speak with emotion .
A younger son , as you know , must be accustomed to abnegation and dependence .  " 
" In my opinion , the youngest son of a count can know very little .
Now seriously , what have you ever known about self-denial and dependency ?
When have you been prevented , for lack of money , from going where you want , or getting everything you want ?
" These are questions at home - and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many difficulties of this nature .
But in terms of greater weight , I could suffer from a lack of money .
Younger sons can not get married where they want .  " 
" Unless they like makeshift women , which I think they do very often . " 
" Our spending habits make us overly dependent , and there is not much in my life rank that can afford to get married without some attention to money . " 
" Did that , Elizabeth thought , meant to me ?
and she colored at the idea; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone:  " And pray , what is the usual price of the youngest son of a count ?
Unless the older brother is very sick , I suppose you would not ask for more than fifty thousand pounds .
He responded in the same style , and the subject dropped .
To interrupt a silence that could make her believe that she was affected by what had happened , she said shortly afterwards:  " I imagine that your cousin brought you with him mainly to have someone at his disposal .
I'm wondering if he's not getting married , to ensure that kind of sustainable convenience .
But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he can do what he wants with her .
" No , "  said Colonel Fitzwilliam ,  " it's an advantage he has to share with me .
I am with him in the care of Miss Darcy .
" Are you indeed ?
And pray what kind of guardians do you do ?
Does your charge give you a lot of problems ?
Girls of her age are sometimes a bit difficult to handle , and if she has the true spirit of Darcy , she may like to have her own way .  " 
While she was talking she watched him look at her seriously; and the manner in which he at once asked her why she supposed that Miss Darcy was likely to give them some anxiety , convinced her that she had somehow become rather close to the truth .
She answered directly:  " You do not need to be afraid .
I never heard any harm from her; and I dare to say she is one of the most malleable creatures in the world .
She is a very big favorite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley .
I think I heard you say that you know them .  " 
" I know them a little .
Their brother is a Gentleman gentleman - he is a great friend of Darcy .  " 
" Oh !
yes , said Elizabeth dryly; Darcy is exceptionally kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious care of him .  " 
" Take care of him !
Yes , I really believe Darcy cares for him where he wants most .
From something he told me in our trip here , I'm right to think that Bingley owes him a lot .
But I have to apologize , because I do not have the right to assume that Bingley was the designated person .
Everything was conjecture .  " 
" What do you mean ? " 
" It's a circumstance that Darcy could not wish to be generally known , because if she were to turn to the lady's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . " 
" You can count on my not mentioning it . " 
And remember , I do not have much reason to assume that it's Bingley .
What he said to me was simply this: that he congratulated himself for having recently saved a friend from the inconveniences of an imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or other details , and I only suspected that Bingley believed the kind the young man to put himself in a scratch of this kind , and to know them for having been together all last summer .
" Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference ? " 
" I understood that there were very strong objections against the lady . " 
" And what arts did he use to separate them ? " 
" He did not tell me about his own arts , "  said Fitzwilliam , smiling .
" He only told me what I said to you now . " 
Elizabeth did not answer and continued , her heart swelling with indignation .
After a little look , Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful .
" I think about what you told me , "  she says .
" Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings .
Why did he have to be the judge ?
" Are you rather willing to call his unofficial intervention ? " 
I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide the inclination of his friend , or why , on his own judgment , he had to determine and direct how his friend should be happy .
But ,  " she continued , remembering herself , "  as we do not know any of the details , it is not fair to condemn him .
Do not assume there was a lot of affection in the case .  " 
" This is not an unnatural conjecture , "  said Fitzwilliam ,  " but it is a diminution of the honor of my cousin's triumph very sadly . " 
This was spoken with jest; but it appeared to him so just an image of Mr. Darcy , that she would not believe herself an answer , and therefore , abruptly changing the conversation spoke on indifferent subjects until they reached the presbytery .
There , locked in her room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard .
It should not be assumed that other people could be served than those with whom she was connected .
There could not be two men in the world on whom Mr. Darcy could have so unlimited an influence .
That he had been preoccupied with the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane , she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement .
But if his own vanity did not mislead him , it was the cause , his pride and whim were the cause of all that Jane had suffered and continued to suffer .
For a time he had ruined all hope of happiness for the most affectionate and generous heart in the world; and no one could say how long an evil he might have inflicted .
" There were very strong objections against the lady , "  said Colonel Fitzwilliam; and those strong objections were probably , she having an uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in London .
" To Jane herself , "  she exclaims ,  " there is no possibility of objection , so much beauty and goodness as she is , her excellent comprehension , her improved mind , and her manners captivating .
Nor could there be anything to reproach my father , who possesses special faculties , but Mr. Darcy himself does not need disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach .
When she thought of her mother , her confidence yielded a little; but she would not tolerate objections to material weight in Mr. Darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper injury from the lack of importance in the relations of his friend , than from their lack of meaning; and she was determined , finally , that he had been partly governed by this kind of pride , and partly by the desire to retain Mr. Bingley for his sister .
The agitation and tears caused by the subject caused a headache; and he grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to his refusal to see Mr. Darcy , he decided not to go to his cousins ​​in Rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea .
Mrs. Collins , seeing that she was really ill , did not urge her to go and , as much as possible , prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not hide his apprehension that Lady Catherine would be rather unhappy to stay at home .
Chapter 34 When they left , Elizabeth , as if she intended to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy , chose for his work the examination of all the letters Jane had written to her since she was in Kent .
They contained no real complaint , and there was no resumption of past events , or any communication of present suffering .
But in all , and in almost all fields , there was a lack of that gaiety which had served to characterize his style , and which , starting from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and well disposed toward everyone had been barely obscured .
Elizabeth noticed every phrase that gave the idea of ​​anxiety , with an attention she had hardly received at first reading .
Mr. Darcy's shameful boasting of the misery he had inflicted on him gave him a more acute sense of his sister's sufferings .
It was comforting to think that her visit to Rosings was to end the day after the next - and , even more , that in less than a fortnight she would be with Jane again and contribute to the restoration of her minds , by all that affection could do .
She could not think of Darcy leaving Kent without remembering that her cousin was to accompany him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it plain that he had no intention , and , although agreeable , did not wish to be displeased with him .
On hearing this , she was suddenly awakened by the sound of the door bell , and her mind was a little agitated by the idea that it was Colonel Fitzwilliam himself , who had already called late in the evening , and could now come to inquire especially after her .
But this idea was soon banished , and her minds were very differently affected , when , to her astonishment , she saw M . Darcy enter the room .
Quickly , he began an investigation into his health , blaming his visit for a desire to hear that she was getting better .
She answered him with cold politeness .
He sat down for a moment , then , getting up , walked in the room .
Elizabeth was surprised , but did not say a word .
After a silence of several minutes , he came to her in a restless manner , and so began:  " I have struggled in vain .
It's not right .
My feelings will not be repressed .
You must allow me to tell you how much I admire you and I love you ardently .
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression .
She looked , colored , doubted and kept silent .
This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the confession of all he felt , and had long felt for her , followed immediately .
He spoke well; but there were feelings other than those of the heart to be detailed; and he was no more eloquent about tenderness than pride .
His feeling of inferiority-of being a degradation-of the family obstacles which had always opposed the inclination , was prolonged with a warmth that seemed due to the consequences he was hurting , but he was unlikely to recommend his costume .
In spite of her deep aversion , she could not be insensitive to the compliment of the affection of such a man , and , although her intentions were not changed for a moment , she was at first sorry for the pain which he was to receive; until , pushed to her resentment by her later tongue , she lost all compassion in anger .
She tried , however , to force herself to answer him patiently , when he should have done so .
He ended by representing to him the strength of this attachment which he had found , in spite of all his efforts , impossible to conquer; and to express his hope that he would now be rewarded with his acceptance of his hand .
In saying that , she could easily see that he had no doubt about a favorable answer .
He spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his face expressed real security .
Such a circumstance could only exasperate further , and when it ceased , color rose in her cheeks , and she said ,  " In such cases , it is , I believe , the established mode of expressing a sense of obligation . for feelings avowed , but unequally , they may be returned .
It is natural that this obligation be felt , and if I could be grateful , I would now like to thank you .
But I can not - I never desired your good opinion , and you certainly gave it the most involuntarily .
I'm sorry for causing pain to anyone .
However , it has been done unconsciously , and I hope it will be short lived .
The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the recognition of your consideration , may have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation .
Mr. Darcy , who was leaning against the mantelpiece , his eyes fixed on his face , seemed to seize his words with as much resentment as surprise .
His complexion became pale with anger , and the confusion of his mind was visible in all his features .
He struggled for the appearance of coolness , and did not open his lips until he thought he had reached her .
The break was for the feelings of Elizabeth terrible .
Finally , in a voice of forced calm , he said:  " And that is the answer I must have the honor to expect !
I would like to know why , with so little civility , I am rejected .
But it's of little importance .  " 
" I might as well ask myself , "  she replied ,  " why , with such an obvious desire to offend me and to insult me , you wanted to tell me that you loved me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ?
Was not that an excuse for incivility , if I were uncivil ?
But I have other provocations .
You know I have .
If my feelings had not decided against you - if they had been indifferent or if they had been supportive , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who was the means to ruin , perhaps forever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?  " 
In pronouncing these words , Mr. Darcy changed color; but the emotion was short , and he listened without trying to interrupt it while she continued:  " I have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you have done there .
You do not dare , you can not deny it , that you have been the main , if not the only , means of separating them from one another - to expose one to censorship of the world for whim and instability , and the another to his derision for disappointed hopes , and both involving them in the most bitter misery .
She stopped , and saw with a slight indignation that he listened with an air which left him with no feeling of remorse .
He even looked at her with a disgruntled smile of disbelief .
" Can you deny that you did it ? " 
she repeated .
With a supposed tranquility , he replied:  " I do not want to deny that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice at my success .
To me , I was nicer than myself .
Elizabeth disdained to appear to notice this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape and was not likely to reconcile it .
" But it is not only this affair , "  she went on ,  " on which my aversion is founded .
Long before that happened , my opinion of you was decided .
Your character took place in the recital I received several months ago from Mr. Wickham .
On this subject , what can you say ?
In what imaginary act of friendship can you defend yourself here ?
or under what false representation can you impose here on others ?
" You're very interested in this gentleman's concerns , "  Darcy said quieterly and with more color .
" Who knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feel an interest in him ? " 
" His misfortunes ! " 
repeated Darcy scornfully; yes , his misfortunes were great .
" And your infliction , "  cried Elizabeth with energy .
" You have reduced it to its current state of poverty - comparative poverty .
You have retained the benefits you need to know that they were designed for him .
You have deprived the best years of his life of this independence , which was no less his reason than his desert .
You did all that !
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule .  " 
" And this , "  said Darcy , walking briskly across the room ,  " is your opinion of me !
This is the estimate in which you hold me !
I thank you for explaining it so well .
My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy !
But perhaps ,  " he added , stopping in his march and turning towards her , "  these offenses could have been neglected , if your honest confession of scruples , which had for a long time prevented me from conceiving seriously , would have not it hurts .
These bitter accusations could have been repressed , had I , with a greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered myself in the belief that I was driven by an unconditional and unmixed inclination; by reason , by reflection , by everything .
But disguise of all kinds is my horror .
I am not ashamed of the feelings I was telling .
They were natural and just .
Can you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your relationships ? Congratulate me on the hope of relationships whose condition in life is so much inferior to mine ?
Elizabeth felt more and more angry every moment; but she tried to speak with coolness when she said ,  " You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your statement affected me in any other way , that it spared me the anxiety that I could have I felt by refusing you if you had behaved in a more gentlemanly manner .
She saw him leave , but he said nothing and continued:  " You could not have made the offer of your hand in a way that would have tempted me to accept it .
Still his astonishment was evident; and he looked at her with an expression of incredulity and mortification mingled .
She continued:  " From the beginning - from the first moment , I could almost say - from my knowledge of you , from your manners , impressing me with the utmost conviction of your arrogance , your vanity , and your selfish disdain of the Other people's feelings were such that they formed the basis of the disapproval on which the following events built such an unshakable aversion , and I had not known you a month before I was the last man in the world whom I could dominate . to get married .  " 
" You have said enough , ma'am .
I fully understand your feelings and I just have to be ashamed of what mine was .
Forgive me for taking so much time and accepting my best wishes for health and happiness .
And with these words he hurriedly left the room , and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the door and leave the house .
The tumult of his mind was now painfully big .
She did not know how to support herself , and real weakness sat and cried for half an hour .
Her astonishment , reflecting on what had happened , was increased with each review .
That she should receive a wedding offer from Mr. Darcy !
That he should have been in love with her for so many months !
So much in love that she wanted to marry her despite all the objections that had prevented her friend from marrying her sister , and who must appear at least with the same force in her case , was almost unbelievable !
It was rewarding to have unconsciously inspired so much affection .
But his pride , his abominable pride - his shameless confession of what he had done to Jane - his unforgivable assurance in recognizing , though he could not justify it , and the insensitive way he had mentioned M Wickham , his cruelty to whom he had not wished to deny , soon surmounted the pity which the consideration of his attachment had excited for a moment .
She continued in very agitated reflections until the sound of Lady Catherine's car made her feel how unequal she was at Charlotte's sight , and hurled her into her room .
Chapter 35 Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations that had finally closed her eyes .
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and , totally indisposed to employment , she resolved , shortly after breakfast , to indulge in air and exercise .
She was heading straight for her favorite walk , when the memory of Mr. Darcy sometimes arriving there stopped him , and instead of entering the park , she went up the alley that was moving away from the toll road .
The pounding park was always the limit of one side , and she soon passed one of the doors into the ground .
After walking two or three times along this part of the lane , she was tempted , by the sweetness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .
The five weeks she had spent in Kent had made a big difference in the country and each day added to the greenery of the first trees .
She was about to continue her walk when she saw a gentleman in the kind of grove bordering the park; he was moving that way; and , fearing to be Mr. Darcy , she withdrew directly .
But the person who was advancing was now near enough to see her , and advancing with eagerness , pronounced her name .
She had turned away; but on hearing that she was calling , though in a voice that proved that it was Mr. Darcy , she went back to the door .
He had already reached her , and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , he said with an air of calm haughtyness:  " I have walked for a while in the grove in the hope of meeting you .
Will you do me the honor to read this letter ?
Then , with a slight bow , returned to the plantation and was soon out of sight .
Without hope of pleasure , but with the greatest curiosity , Elizabeth opened the letter and , to her growing wonder , saw an envelope containing two sheets of writing paper , written from scratch , with a very tight hand .
The envelope itself was also full .
Pursuing her way along the path , she then began .
It was dated Rosings at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows:  " Do not worry , madam , upon receiving this letter , by the apprehension that it contains the repetition of these sentiments or the renewal of these offers . who were last night so disgusting for you .
I write without any intention of painting you or lowering myself , by relying on vows which , for the happiness of one and all , can not be forgotten too soon; and the effort which the formation and the reading of this letter should occasion ought to have been spared , if my character did not require it to be written and read .
You must therefore forgive the freedom with which I ask your attention; your feelings , I know , will give you involuntarily , but I ask for your justice .
Two offenses of a very different nature , and of another order of importance , you confided to me last night .
The first mentioned was that , regardless of the feelings of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in contempt of the honor and humanity , ruined immediate prosperity and castigated Mr. Wickham's prospects .
Willingly and without pleasure to have chased away the companion of my youth , the recognized favorite of my father , a young man who had little other dependence than our patronage , and who had been brought up to await his effort , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young people , whose affection could be growth of only a few weeks , could not be compared .
But from the severity of this blame which was so generously granted last night , respecting each circumstance , I hope to be assured in the future , when the next account of my actions and motives has been read .
If , in the explanation of them , which is due to me , I am obliged to report feelings which may offend you , I can only say that I am sorry .
The need must be respected , and other excuses would be absurd .
" I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before seeing , like others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country .
But it was only the night of the dance in Netherfield that I felt that he felt a strong attachment .
I had often seen him in love before .
At that ball , while I had the honor of dancing with you , I was first made aware , by the accidental information of Sir William Lucas , that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to an expectation . of their marriage .
He spoke of it as a certain event whose time alone could be undecided .
From that moment , I observed attentively the behavior of my friend; and I could then perceive that her partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever seen in him .
Your sister I also watched .
Her eyes and manner were open , cheerful and engaging as always , but without any sign of particular consideration , and I remained convinced of the evening exam , that although she received her attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any feeling involvement .  .
If you are not mistaken here , I must have been wrong .
Your superior knowledge of your sister should make it likely .
If that is so , if I was deceived by such an error to inflict pain on him , your resentment was not unreasonable .
But I would not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister's face and air was such that she could have given the most penetrating observer the conviction that , however pleasant she may be , her heart was not likely to be easily touched .
That I wanted to believe it indifferent is certain - but I venture to say that my research and my decisions are not generally influenced by my hopes or my fears .
I did not think she was indifferent because I wanted her; I believed him on an impartial conviction , as sincerely as I wanted him in reason .
My objections to marriage were not only those which I recognized last night to have the greatest force of passion to put aside , in my own case; the lack of connection could not be so bad for my friend as for me .
But there were other causes of repugnance; Of the causes which still existed , and which existed to an equal degree in both cases , I had endeavored to forget , because they were not immediately before me .
These causes must be indicated , although briefly .
The situation of your mother's family , though reprehensible , was nothing compared to that want of convenience so frequent , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and sometimes even by your father .
Sorry me .
It hurts me to offend you .
But in the midst of your concern for the faults of your nearest relatives , and your dissatisfaction with this representation , let yourself be comforted to consider that , for having led you in such a way as to avoid any part of censorship like this , there is no less than praise bestowed upon you and your elder sister , that it is honorable in the sense and disposition of both .
I will only say further than from what happened that night , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and all the incentives that had pushed me before , to preserve my friend from what I thought an unhappy affair .
He left Netherfield for London the following day , as you know , I'm sure , with the intention of coming back soon .
" The part I acted must now be explained .
The anxiety of her sisters was also excited by mine; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered , and , as it was reasonable not to lose time in detaching their brother , we soon resolved to join him directly to London .
So we went - and there I willingly engaged in the function of pointing out to my friend the ills of such a choice .
I described them and applied them fervently .
But although this remonstrance might have stunned or retarded her determination , I do not think that she would have prevented marriage , had she not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not to give indifference . of your sister .
He had previously thought that she would render her affection sincere , if not with respect .
But Bingley has a great natural modesty , with greater dependence on my judgment than on his own .
To convince him , therefore , that he was mistaken , was not a very difficult point .
To persuade him not to return to Hertfordshire , when this sentence had been given , was hardly a work of a moment .
I can not blame myself for doing so much .
There is only one part of my conduct in this whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is because I have deigned to adopt the measures of art to the point of hiding your sister in town .
I knew it myself , as Miss Bingley knew; but his brother still does not know it .
What they might have encountered without any adverse consequences may be probable; but his esteem did not seem so extinguished that he could see it without danger .
Perhaps this dissimulation , this disguise , was below me; it is done , however , and it was done for the better .
On this subject , I have nothing more to say , no other excuses to offer .
If I have hurt your sister's feelings , it has been done without knowing it , and although the motives which govern me may seem to you very naturally insufficient , I have not yet learned to condemn them .
" With regard to this other and heavier accusation of hurting Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by exposing you to his entire relationship with my family .
From what he particularly accused me , I am ignorant; but from the truth of what I will tell , I can cite more than one witness of unmistakable veracity .
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who for several years directed all the domains of Pemberley , and whose good conduct , in the exercise of his confidence , naturally inclined my father to render him a service , and George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore generously granted .
My father supported him at school , and then at Cambridge - the most important help , for his own father , still poor from his wife's extravagance , could not have given him the education of a gentleman .
My father did not only love the society of this young man , whose manners were always engaging; he also had the highest opinion of him , and hoping that the church would be his profession , destined to provide for it .
As for me , it's been many years since I started to think of him in a very different way .
The vicious tendencies , the want of principle which he was careful not to prevent from his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of the same age as himself and who had the opportunity to see him without monitoring . moments that Mr. Darcy could not have .
Again , I'm going to hurt you - how much you alone can say .
But whatever feelings Mr. Wickham has created , a hint of their nature will not prevent me from displaying his true character - it adds yet another motive .
" My excellent father died about five years ago , and his commitment to Mr. Wickham was so strong that he particularly urged me , in his will , to promote his advancement in the best way his profession could  . . . and if he took orders , he wanted a precious family life to be his as soon as it became vacant .
There was also a legacy of a thousand pounds .
His father did not survive long in mine , and in the six months following these events , Mr. Wickham wrote to me that , having finally decided not to receive orders , he hoped that I would not find it unreasonable to expect a more immediate monetary payment . advantage , instead of preference , of which he could not benefit .
He intended , he added , to study law , and I must be aware that the interest of a thousand pounds would be a very inadequate support .
I preferred rather than to believe him sincere; but , in any case , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal .
I knew that Mr. Wickham should not be an ecclesiastic; the matter was soon settled - he resigned all to claim for help in the church , was it possible that he could ever be able to receive it , and accepted in exchange three thousand pounds .
Any connection between us now seemed dissolved .
I thought too bad of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town .
In town , I think he lived mainly , but his study of the law was only a sham , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation .
For about three years , I have not heard much about him . but on the death of the holder of the life which had been destined for him , he addressed it to me again by letter for the presentation .
His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were extremely bad .
He had found the law a very unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved to be ordained , if I introduced him to the living in question - which he hoped there could be no doubt , for he was well assured that I I did not have someone else to fill , and I could not have forgotten the intentions of my revered father .
You will hardly reproach me for having refused to conform to this prayer , or for having resisted any repetition .
His resentment was proportionate to the distress of his circumstances - and he was probably as violent in his abuse of me towards others as in his reproaches to myself .
After this period , any appearance of knowledge has been abandoned .
How he lived I do not know .
But last summer , he was again the most painfully obtruded in my opinion .
" I must now mention a circumstance that I would like to forget myself , and that nothing less than the present should inspire me to reveal to every human being .
That said , I do not doubt your secret .
My sister , who is more than ten years old , was placed in the custody of my mother's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself .
About a year ago , she was removed from school and an institution was established for her in London; and last summer she went with Ramsgate , the lady who presided over it; and he was also Mr. Wickham , no doubt by design; for there had been an earlier acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were sadly deceived; and by his connivance and his help , he recommended himself so far to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of her kindness towards her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to a fugue .
She was then only fifteen , which must be her excuse; and after having said his imprudence , I am happy to add that I owed him the knowledge .
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the planned abduction , and Georgiana , unable to bear the thought of crying and offending a brother she almost looked like a father , recognized me .
You can imagine how I felt and how I acted .
Consideration for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was naturally removed from office .
The principal object of Mr. Wickham was undoubtedly the fortune of my sister , which is thirty thousand livres; but I can not refrain from supposing that the hope of avenging myself was a strong incentive .
His revenge would have been complete indeed .
" This , madam , is a faithful account of every event with which we have been mixed , and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit you of cruelty to Mr. Wickham .
I do not know in what way , in what form of falsehood he had imposed you; but his success may not be surprising .
Ignorant as you have been previously of all that concerns either , the detection could not be in your power , and the suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
You may be wondering why all this was not told you last night , but I was not enough of myself to know what could or should be revealed .
For the truth of all that relates here , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , thanks to our close relationship and constant intimacy and , more importantly , as the executor of my father , inevitably has each particular of these transactions .
If your horror of the self renders my affirmations worthless , you can not prevent yourself , by the same cause , from entrusting yourself to my cousin; and that there may be opportunity to consult it , I will try to find an opportunity to put this letter in your hands during the morning .
I will only add , God bless you .
" FITZWILLIAM DARCY "  Chapter 36 If Elizabeth , when Mr. Darcy gave him the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had not expected any of its contents .
But as they were , it is possible to suppose how ardently they were crossing them , and what an annoyance of emotion they excited .
His feelings while reading were barely defined .
Amazingly , she understood at first that he believed that every excuse was in his power; and firmly persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , that a just feeling of shame would not hide .
With a strong prejudice against everything he could say , she started telling what had happened in Netherfield .
She read with an eagerness that left her with little sense of understanding and , impatient to know what the next sentence could bring , she was unable to deal with the meaning of the one she had in front of her .
Her conviction of her sister's insensitivity she immediately resolved to be false; and her account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have the desire to do her justice .
He expressed no regret for what he did that satisfied him; his style was not penitent , but haughty .
It was pride and insolence .
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham - when she read with a clearer attention a report of events which , so true , must overthrow every darling opinion of its worth , and which bore an affinity so alarming to his own story of himself - his feelings were even more deeply painful and more difficult to define .
Amazement , apprehension and even horror oppressed him .
She wanted to discredit him completely , exclaiming several times:  " It must be false !
It can not be !
It must be the grossest lie !  " 
and when she had read the whole letter , though she knew almost nothing of the last page or both , she pushed her away , protesting that she would not look at her , that she would never look at them again .
In this disturbed state of mind , with thoughts that did not rest on anything , she continued; but that would not do; at the end of a half-minute the letter unfolded again , and , recovering herself as best she could , she recommenced the mortifying reading of all that pertained to Wickham , and ordered herself to examine the meaning of each sentence .
The story of his relationship with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had told himself; and the benevolence of the late Mr. Darcy , although she had not yet known the extent of it , was in accord with her own words .
Until now , each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will , the difference was great .
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she remembered her very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and for a few moments she flattered herself that her desires were not mistaken .
But when she read and re-read with the greatest attention , the details that immediately followed Wickham's resignation from all pretense to the living , from receiving a sum as large as three thousand pounds , she had to hesitate again .
She put the letter down , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality - deliberate about the probability of each statement - but with little success .
On both sides , it was only an affirmation .
Once again , she read; but each line proved more clearly that the affair , to which she had thought impossible that any artifice could represent , as well as render the conduct of Mr. Darcy less infamous , was capable of a trick which ought to make it wholly irreproachable in all .
The extravagance and general debauchery he had scrupulously ignored by Mr. Wickham had shocked him greatly; especially since she could not bring any proof of her injustice .
She had never heard of him before entering the militia , where he had committed to the persuasion of the young man who , by accidentally meeting him in town , had renewed a slight acquaintance .
From his old way of life , nothing was known in Hertfordshire , but what he was saying .
As for her real character , if the information had been in her power , she had never had the desire to inquire .
His countenance , his voice , and his manners had established him at once in possession of all the virtues .
She tried to remember some example of kindness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , which might save him from Mr. Darcy's attacks; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , expiate the occasional errors in which she would attempt to classify what Mr. Darcy had described as idleness and vice for several years in a row .
But no memory of this kind helped her .
She could see it instantly in front of her , in all the charms of air and skill; but she could not remember any property more substantial than the general approbation of the neighborhood , and the esteem her social powers had acquired for her in disorder .
After a pause on this point for a considerable time , she continued to read .
But unfortunately !
the story which followed , of his designs on Miss Darcy , received some confirmation of what had happened between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself the day before; and finally she was sent back for the truth of every detail to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself - from whom she had previously received information of his close concern in all the affairs of his cousin , and whose character she had no reason for to question .
At one point she had almost resolved to address him , but the idea was stopped by the awkwardness of the request , and finally completely banished by the belief that Mr. Darcy would never have risked such a proposal , he had not been well assured of the corroboration of his cousin .
She remembered all that had happened in the conversation between Wickham and herself , in their first night at Mr. Phillips .
Many of his expressions were still fresh in his memory .
She was now impressed with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered if it had escaped him before .
She saw the indelicacy of putting herself forward as he had done , and the inconstancy of her professions with her conduct .
She remembered that he had boasted of not being afraid to see Mr. Darcy , that Mr. Darcy could leave the country , but that he must remain standing; Yet he had avoided the Netherfield Ball next week .
She also remembered that until the Netherfield family had left the country he had told his story only to herself; but after their abduction he had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserve , no scruples about casting Mr. Darcy's character , although he had assured him that the father's respect would always prevent him from exposing the son .
How much does everything appear now in which he was concerned !
Her attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of only mercenary and hateful views; and the mediocrity of his fortune no longer proved the moderation of his desires , but his eagerness to seize everything .
Her behavior on her own might now have no tolerable motive; he had been deceived as to his fortune , or had satisfied his vanity by encouraging the preference which she thought he had most imprudently displayed .
Every persistent struggle in his favor became weaker and weaker; and , in another justification of Mr. Darcy , she could only admit that Mr. Bingley , questioned by Jane , had long asserted his innocence in the affair; As proud and disgusting as her manners were , she had never , in the course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance who had brought them together for a long time , and had given her a sort of intimacy with her manners - considering all that betrayed her . to be unscrupulous or unjust - all that speaks to him of irreligious or immoral habits; that , among his relations , he was esteemed and esteemed , that even Wickham had given him the merit of being a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister , that he proved him capable of a kind feeling; that if his actions had been what Mr. Wickham represented them , such a gross violation of all that was right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and this friendship between a capable man and a man as amiable as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible .
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself .
Neither Darcy nor Wickham could think without feeling blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd .
" As I did wrong ! " 
She cried;  " I am proud of my discernment !
Me , who appreciated me on my abilities !
who has often disdained the generous candor of my sister , and satisfied my vanity with useless or blamable mistrust !
What humiliation is this discovery !
Still , how just a humiliation !
If I had been in love , I could not have been more miserably blind !
But vanity , not love , has been my folly .
Satisfied with the preference of one , and offended by the negligence of the other , at the very beginning of our knowledge , I have courted pre- session and ignorance , and chased reason , where one or the other other was concerned .
Until that moment , I never knew myself .
From her to Jane - from Jane to Bingley , her thoughts were in a line that soon reminded her that Mr. Darcy's explanation had seemed very inadequate , and she read it again .
The effect of a second reading was very different .
How could she deny this credit to her assertions in one case , which she had been obliged to give in the other ?
He declared himself totally careless of his sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been .
She could not deny the justice of Jane's description either .
She felt that Jane's feelings , although fervent , were not very manifest , and that there was in her air and her manner a constant complacency , rarely met with great sensibility .
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family was mentioned in terms of such a mortifying but deserved reproach , her sense of shame was severe .
The justice of the charge struck her too much by the force of denial , and the circumstances to which he referred in particular to the passage of Netherfield , and confirming all his first disapprobation , could not impress him more than his .
The compliment to herself and her sister was not inevitable .
She calmed down , but she could not console her for the scorn that had been attracted to the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her closest relatives , and that she reflected how much the credit of both was to be hurt by such unseemly conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known .
After wandering for two hours in the lane , giving way to all kinds of thoughts - re-examining events , determining probabilities , reconciling , as much as she could , to such a sudden and important change , fatigue and remembering her long absence , finally made her go home; and she entered the house with the desire to appear gay as usual , and the resolution to repress the reflections which would render her unfit for conversation .
He was immediately told that the two gentlemen of Rosings had called each one during his absence; Mr. Darcy , only for a few minutes , to take leave - but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for his return , and almost resolved to walk after her until she could be found .
Elizabeth could only feel the anxiety of having missed her; she really rejoiced .
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could only think of her letter .
Chapter 37 The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning , and Mr. Collins , who was waiting near the lodges , to pay homage to them , was able to report the agreeable intelligence of appearing in very good health , and as tolerable spirits , as one could imagine . to wait for it , after the melancholy scene so recently spent in Rosings .
At Rosings he hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter . and when she returned , she reported with great satisfaction a message from her , telling her that she felt so boring that she wanted to have them all dine at her place .
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without remembering that , had she chosen him , she could have been presented to him as her future niece; she could not think either without smiling at the indignation of her friend .
" What would she have said ?
how would she behave ?
were questions she was having fun with .
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party .
" I assure you , I feel it extremely , "  said Lady Catherine;  " I do not think anyone feels the loss of friends as much as I do .
But I am particularly attached to these young people , and I know they are so attached to me !
They were too sorry to go !
But they still are .
The dear colonel rallied his spirit until he was at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most intensely , more , I think , than last year .
His attachment to Rosings certainly increases .  " 
Mr. Collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw here , which was kindly smiled by the mother and the daughter .
Lady Catherine remarked , after dinner , that Miss Bennett seemed demoralized , and realizing for herself , supposing she did not like to come back so early , she added ,  " But if so , you must write to your mother and ask that you stay a little longer .
Mrs. Collins will be very happy with your company , I'm sure .  " 
" I am very much obliged to your kind invitation , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " but I have not the power to accept it .
I must be in town next Saturday .  " 
" Why , at this rate , you would have been here only six weeks .
I was expecting you to stay two months .
I told Mrs. Collins before coming .
There can be no opportunity for you to go so early .
Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you another fortnight .
" But my father can not .
He wrote last week to speed up my return .  " 
" Oh !
your father can of course spare you , if your mother can .
Girls never have so many consequences for a father .
And if you stay a full month , it will be in my power to take one of you to London , because I go there in early June for a week; and since Dawson does not oppose the carriage box , there will be room for one of you - and if the weather were to be cool , I would not mind taking you both because you are neither one nor the other . you big .  " 
" You are all kindness , ma'am , but I believe we must respect our original plan . " 
Lady Catherine seemed resigned .
" Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them .
You know that I always speak in my mind , and I can not stand the thought of two young women traveling alone .
It is very inappropriate .
You have to manage to send someone .
I have the biggest dislike in the world for this kind of thing .
Young women must always be properly supervised and followed , according to their situation in life .
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I insisted she go with two servants .
Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy , Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with convenience in a different manner .
I am overly attentive to all these things .
You must send John with the girls , Mrs. Collins .
I am glad that it occurred to me to mention it; because it would be really discouraging for you to let them go alone .
" My uncle must send a servant for us . " 
" Oh !
Your uncle !
He keeps a servant , does not he ?
I am very happy that you have someone who thinks about these things .
Where will you change horses ?
Oh !
Bromley , of course .
If you mention my name to the bell , you will be taken care of .  " 
Lady Catherine had many more questions to ask about their journey , and since she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , that Elizabeth thought she was lucky for her; or , with such a busy mind , she could have forgotten where she was .
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; every time she was alone , she yielded the greatest relief; and there was not a day going on without a solitary walk , where she could indulge in all the delights of unpleasant memories .
Mr. Darcy's letter was a fair way to know soon by heart .
She studied each sentence; and his feelings towards his author were sometimes very different .
When she remembered the style of her address , she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how much she had unjustly condemned and reprimanded her , her anger had turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion .
His attachment excited gratitude , his general character respected him; but she could not approve it; she could not either repent for a moment of her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination to see him again .
In his past behavior , there was a constant source of annoyance and regret; and in the unhappy faults of his family , a subject of sorrow even heavier .
They had no hope of cure .
His father , happy to make fun of them , would never make an effort to contain the vertigo of his youngest girls; and his mother , with so far from correcting manners , was entirely insensitive to evil .
Elizabeth had often met with Jane to try to verify the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence , what chance might there be of improvement ?
Catherine , weak-minded , irritable , and completely guided by Lydia , had always been offended by their advice; and Lydia , voluntary and careless , would hardly give them an audience .
They were ignorant , idle , and vain .
While there was an officer at Meryton , they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was at a walk from Longbourn , they would go there forever .
Anxiety in Jane's name was another dominant concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation , in restoring Bingley's previous good opinion , increased the meaning of what Jane had lost .
His affection proved sincere , and his conduct was rid of all blame , unless one could attach to the implicit trust in his friend .
What then was the thought that , from a situation so desirable from every point of view , so full of advantages , so promising of happiness , Jane had been deprived by the madness and indecorum of her own family !
When one adds to these memories the development of Wickham's character , one can easily believe that happy spirits who had rarely been previously depressed were now so affected that it was almost impossible for him to appear cheerful enough .
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of his stay as they had been at the beginning .
The very last evening was spent there; and his lady asked minutely the details of their journey , gave them indications as to the best method of packing , and was so anxious to place the dresses in the right manner , that Maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the morning work , and repacking his trunk .
When they separated , Lady Catherine , with much condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to return to Hunsford next year; and Mademoiselle de Bourgh applied herself to bowing and reaching out to both .
Chapter 38 On Saturday morning , Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity to pay the courtesies he deemed indispensable .
" I do not know , Miss Elizabeth , "  he said ,  " if Mrs. Collins has again expressed her sense of kindness in coming to us , but I am sure you will not leave the house without receiving thanks . " 
The favor of your company was very felt , I assure you .
We know how difficult it is to tempt someone to our humble abode .
Our way of life , our little rooms and our servants , and the little we see of the world , make Hunsford extremely boring for a young woman like you; but I hope you will think we are grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you from spending your time unpleasantly .
Elizabeth was impatient with her thanks and assurances of happiness .
She had spent six weeks with great pleasure; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , were to make her feel obligated .
Mr. Collins was satisfied and , with a more gracious solemnity , replied:  " It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have spent your time without inconvenience .
We have certainly done our best . and , fortunately , we have the power to present you with a very superior society and , because of our relations with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home , I believe we can flatter ourselves that your visit to Hunsford can not be completely boring .
Our situation with Lady Catherine's family is indeed the kind of extraordinary benefit and blessing that few can boast about .
You see on what foot we are .
You see how we are continually engaged there .
In truth , I must admit that , with all the inconveniences of this humble presbytery , I should not think of anyone who remains an object of compassion , while they share our intimacy in Rosings .
The words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was forced to walk in the room , while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences .
" You can , indeed , bring a very favorable report of us to Hertfordshire , my dear cousin .
I flatter myself at least that I can do it .
The great attentions of Lady Catherine to Mrs. Collins , of which you have been the daily witness; and quite , I think , it does not seem that your friend has attracted an unfortunate - but on this point it will be as well to keep quiet .
Only , let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can with all my heart cordially wish you the same happiness in marriage .
My dear Charlotte and I have only one mind and one way of thinking .
There is in all a resemblance of the most remarkable of character and ideas between us .
We seem to have been designed for each other .  " 
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in her domestic comfort .
She was not sorry , however , to have the story of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang .
Poor Charlotte !
it was melancholy to leave her to such a society !
But she had chosen him with open eyes; and although she obviously regrets that her visitors were going , she did not seem to be asking for compassion .
His house and household , his parish and his poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms .
Finally , the chair arrived , the trunks were tied up , the parcels placed inside , and it was said that she was ready .
After an affectionate separation between the friends , Elizabeth was assisted by Mr. Collins , and as they walked in the garden , he commissioned it with his best regards to all his family , not to mention his thanks for the kindness that he had received at Longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , though unknown .
He then handed it over , Maria followed her , and the door was about to be closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some dismay , that they had forgotten until then to leave a message to the ladies of Rosings .
" But , "  he added ,  " you will of course want your humble respects addressed to them , with thanks for their kindness to you during your stay here . " 
Elizabeth made no objection; The door was then closed , and the car left .
" Good grace ! " 
exclaimed Maria , after a few minutes of silence , it seems to me a day or two since we arrived !
and yet how many things have happened !
" A lot indeed , "  said his companion with a sigh .
" We dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea twice !
How much will I have to say !  " 
Elizabeth added in private ,  " And how much I will have to hide ! " 
Their trip was made without much conversation , or no alarm; and within four hours after leaving Hunsford , they arrived at Mr. Gardiner's , where they were to remain a few days .
Jane looked good , and Elizabeth had scarcely an opportunity to study her mind amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them .
But Jane had to go home with her , and at Longbourn there would be enough leisure to watch .
It was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for Longbourn , before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals .
To know that she had the power to reveal what would so surprisingly surprise Jane , and that she must at the same time gratify so much of her own vanity that she had not yet been able to reason , was such a temptation of openness that nothing could have conquered only the state of indecision in which she remained on the extent of what she was to communicate; and her fear , if she entered the subject once more , to hasten to repeat something of Bingley that would only further distress her sister .
Chapter 39 It was the second week of May , when the three girls went out together from Gracechurch Street to the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and as they approached the inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to join them , they quickly perceived , as a sign of the coachman's punctuality , that Kitty and Lydia were looking in the dining-room at the top of the stairs .
These two girls had been over an hour in the square , happily employed to visit an opposing milliner , looking at the guard sentry , and dressing in a salad and a cucumber .
After having welcomed their sisters , they triumphantly sported a table set up with such cold meat , as a pantry did , exclaiming:  " Is not it agreeable ?
Is not this a pleasant surprise ?
" And we intend to treat you all , "  added Lydia ,  " but you must lend us the money , for we have just passed ours to the store .
Then , showing his shopping -  " Look here , I bought this hat .
I do not think it's very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not .
I will dismount it as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it better .  " 
And when her sisters abused her as ugly , she added , with perfect insouciance ,  " Oh !
but there were two or three more ugly in the shop; and when I buy a nicer satin to cut it with fresh , I think it will be very bearable .
Besides , that will not mean much what we wear this summer , after the county leaves Meryton , and they leave in a fortnight .
" Are they indeed ! " 
exclaimed Elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction .
They are going camping near Brighton , and I want dad to take us all there for the summer !
It would be such a delicious diet; and I dare say it would cost almost nothing .
Mom would like to go from all things too !
Just think what a miserable summer we will have !
" Yes , "  Elizabeth thought ,  " it would be a delicious arrangement indeed , and completely do for us at a time .
Good heaven !
Brighton , and a whole camp of soldiers , for us , already overwhelmed by a poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton !
" Now I have news for you , "  said Lydia , as they sat down at the table .
" What do you think ?
This is great news - the news of capital - and a certain person we all love !
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told he did not need to stay .
Lydia laughed and said ,  " Yes , it's like your formality and your discretion .
You thought the waiter should not hear , as if he cared !
I dare to say that he often hears things harder than I am going to say .
But he's an ugly guy !
I'm glad he left .
I have never seen a chin as long in my life .
Well , but now for my news; it is the dear Wickham; Too good for the server , is not it ?
There is no danger that Wickham marries Mary King .
There is for you !
She went down to her uncle's house in Liverpool and left to stay .
Wickham is safe .  " 
" And Mary King is safe ! " 
Elizabeth added;  " safe from an imprudent connection as to fortune . " 
" She is a great idiot to leave , if she loved him . " 
" But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , "  said Jane .
" I'm sure there is not on his .
I'll answer that , he never cared about three straws about him - who could talk about such a dirty little thing with freckles ?
Elizabeth was shocked to think that , so incapable of such grossness of expression itself , the grossness of the sentiment was hardly other than her own breast had fed and believed liberal !
As soon as everyone had eaten , and the older ones had paid , the car was ordered; and after some effort , the whole party , with all their boxes , purses , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of the purchases of Kitty and Lydia , sat there .
" How well we are all crammed , "  cried Lydia .
" I'm glad I bought my hat , except for the pleasure of having another bandbox !
Well , now , let's be very comfortable and cozy , and let's talk and laugh all the way back .
And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you since you left .
Have you seen pleasant men ?
Have you had flirts ?
I was hoping that one of you would have a husband before your return .
Jane will soon be an old girl , I declare .
She is almost twenty-two years old !
Lord , how shameful I should be not to be married before the age of twenty-two !
Aunt Phillips wants you to have husbands , you can not think .
She says Lizzy would have taken Mr. Collins better; but I do not think there would have been any pleasure .
Lord !
how I would like to marry before one of you; and then I chaperon you about all the balls .
Dear me !
The other day , Colonel Forster , we had a lot of fun .
Kitty and I had to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to do some dancing in the evening; (By the way , Mrs. Forster and I are such friends !)
and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was sick , and so Pen was forced to come alone; and then , what do you think we did ?
We dress Chamberlayne express in women's outfit to pass for a lady , do not think what a pleasure !
Not a soul knew it , but the colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and I , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her robes; and you can not imagine how he looked !
When Denny , Wickham , Pratt and two or three other men came in , they did not know him at all .
Lord !
how I laughed !
and so Mrs. Forster .
I thought I should have died .
And that made men suspect something , and they quickly understood what was happening .
Lydia , aided by Kitty's allusions and additions , tried to amuse her companions to Longbourn with such stories of stories and good jokes .
Elizabeth listened as little as she could , but it was impossible to escape the frequent mention of Wickham's name .
Their reception at home was the nicest .
Mrs. Bennet was delighted to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner Mr. Bennet voluntarily told Elizabeth:  " I'm glad you came back , Lizzy .
Their party in the dining-room was great , for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects who occupied them: Lady Lucas inquired after Maria , after the welfare and the fowl of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged , on the one hand , collecting an account of Jane's current fashion , which was sitting below her , and , on the other hand , distributing them all to the youngest Lucases; and Lydia , in a louder voice than the others , enumerated the various pleasures of the morning for those who wished to hear it .
" Oh !
Mary , she said , I wish you had gone with us , because we had so much fun !
As we went , Kitty and I made the blinds , and pretended that there was no one in the car; and I should have gone all the way , if Kitty had not been sick; and when we arrived at the George , I think we behaved very generously , because we treated the other three with the best cold lunch in the world , and if you were gone , we would have treated you too .
And when we left it was so much fun !
I thought we should never have gotten into the coach .
I was ready to die laughing .
And then we were so happy all the way back !
we spoke and laughed so hard that anyone could have heard us ten miles away !
To this Mary replied very gravely:  " Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures !
They would no doubt agree with the generality of female spirits .
But I admit that they would have no charm for me , I would much prefer a book .
But from this answer , Lydia did not hear a word .
She rarely listened to anyone for more than half a minute and never cared for Mary .
In the afternoon , Lydia was in a hurry with the other girls to go to Meryton and see how everyone was going; but Elizabeth strongly opposed the scheme .
It must not be said that Miss Bennets could not be home half a day before she was in pursuit of the officers .
There was another reason for his opposition as well .
She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again and was determined to avoid him for as long as possible .
The comfort of the impending remoteness of the regiment was far beyond any expression .
In a fortnight they had to leave - and once she left , she hoped there would be nothing left to torment her .
She had not spent many hours at home until she realized that the Brighton project , which Lydia had told them at the inn , was frequently discussed between her parents .
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the slightest intention of yielding; but his answers were at once so vague and so equivocal , that his mother , though often discouraged , did not yet despair of succeeding at last .
Chapter 40 Elizabeth's impatience to inform Jane of what had happened could no longer be overcome; and finally , resolved to suppress all that concerned her sister , and to prepare her to be surprised , she told him the next day the stage manager between M . Darcy and herself .
The astonishment of Miss Bennet was soon diminished by the strong fraternal partiality which made Elizabeth's admiration perfectly natural; and all surprise was soon lost in other feelings .
She regretted that M . Darcy had delivered his feelings in a manner so imprudent as to recommend them; but she regretted even more the misfortune which the refusal of her sister had given her .
" He was so sure of being sure of success , "  she said ,  " and he certainly should not have appeared , but consider how much he must increase his disappointment !
" Indeed , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " I am sincerely sorry for him , but he has other feelings , which will probably soon dispel his respect for me .
You do not blame me , however , to refuse it ?
" You blame !
Oh not .  " 
" But you blame me for speaking so warmly about Wickham ? " 
" No - I do not know if you were wrong to say what you did . " 
- But you'll know , when I tell you what happened the next day .
She then spoke about the letter , repeating all of her content regarding George Wickham .
What a blow it was for poor Jane !
who would have willingly crossed the world without believing that so much malice existed in all the human race , as it was collected in an individual .
Darcy's gratitude , though grateful to her feelings , did not make her either able to console her for such a discovery .
She strove most ardently to prove the probability of the error and sought to clear one without involving the other .
" That will not do , "  said Elizabeth;  " You will never be able to do both good for anything .
Make your choice , but you must be satisfied with one .
There is only such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make a good kind of man; and from a while ago he moved about .
For my part , I am inclined to believe all this to Darcy; but you will do what you want .
It did take a while before a smile could be extorted from Jane .
" I do not know when I was more shocked , "  she said .
" Wickham so very bad !
It is a belief almost past .
And poor Mr. Darcy !
Dear Lizzy , just consider what he must have suffered .
Such a disappointment !
and with the knowledge of your bad opinion , too !
and have to tell such a thing from his sister !
It's really too painful .
I am sure you must feel it .  " 
" Oh !
no , my regret and my compassion are all extinguished by seeing you so full of both .
I know that you will give him so much justice , that I become more and more carefree and indifferent .
Your profusion makes me save; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be light as a feather .
" Poor Wickham !
there is such an expression of kindness in his face !
so much openness and sweetness in his manners !
" There was certainly a lot of mismanagement in the education of these two young men .
One has all the good , and the other all the appearance .
" I never thought that Mr. Darcy was so deficient in the appearance of what you used to do . " 
" And yet , I wanted to be unusually intelligent by taking such dislike for him , for no reason .
It is such a stimulus for genius , such an opening for the mind , to have an aversion of this kind .
One can be continually abusive without saying anything right; but we can not always make fun of a man without now and then stumble on something of wit .  " 
" Lizzy , when you read this letter for the first time , I'm sure you could not handle the issue as you do now . " 
" Indeed , I could not .
I was quite uncomfortable , I can say unhappy .
And with no one to talk about how I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I was not so weak and vain and absurd that I knew I had !
Oh !
how I wanted you !
" How unfortunate it is that you have used such strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for the moment they do not seem deserved .
" Certainly .
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is the most natural consequence of the prejudices I had encouraged .
There is one point on which I want your opinion .
I want to know if I should , or should not , make our knowledge in general understand the character of Wickham .
Miss Bennet paused a little and replied ,  " There certainly can not be an opportunity to expose it so terribly .
What is your opinion ? " 
" That should not be attempted .
Mr. Darcy did not allow me to make his communication public .
On the contrary , each particular parent of his sister had to be kept as much as possible for me; and if I try to undeceive the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ?
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half of the good people of Meryton to attempt to place him under a kind light .
I am not equal to that .
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not tell anyone what it really is .
In a while , everything will be discovered , and then we will risk their stupidity not to know it before .
For now I will not say anything about it .  " 
" You're absolutely right .
Making public his mistakes could ruin him forever .
He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to restore a character .
We must not make it desperate .  " 
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was appeased by this conversation .
She had gotten rid of two of the secrets that had weighed on her for a fortnight , and she was sure to be a listening ear in Jane whenever she wanted to talk about it again .
But there was still something hidden , whose prudence forbade disclosure .
She did not dare to tell the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter , nor to explain to her sister how much she had been sincerely appreciated by her friend .
Here was the knowledge to which nobody could participate; and she was aware that nothing less than a perfect agreement between the parties could justify it by rejecting this last clutter of mystery .
" And then , "  she said ,  " if this very unlikely event were to happen , I would only know what Bingley can say in a much more agreeable way .
Freedom of communication can not be mine until it has lost all its value !
She was now , settling at home , at leisure to observe the real state of minds of her sister .
Jane was not happy .
She has always loved a very affectionate affection for Bingley .
As she had never even imagined herself in love , her esteem had all the warmth of the first attachment , and , of her age and disposition , a greater firmness than most first attachments often boast; and so ardently she valued her memory , and preferred it to every other man , that all his good sense , and all his attention to the feelings of his friends , were required to verify the indulgence of those regrets which must have been his harmful clean health and tranquility .
" Well , Lizzy , "  said Mrs. Bennet one day ,  " what do you think of Jane's sad affair ?
For my part , I am determined never to speak to anyone again .
I told my sister Phillips the other day .
But I can not know that Jane saw anything from him in London .
Well , he's a very poor young man - and I do not think there's any chance in her world of having her now .
We are not talking about his return to Netherfield in the summer; and I also asked everyone who is likely to know .
" I do not think he will live longer in Netherfield . " 
" So much flat !
it's the way he wants it .
Nobody wants him to come .
Although I will always say that he used my extremely sick daughter; and if I were she , I would not have borne that .
Well , I'm sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he did .  " 
But as Elizabeth could not be comforted by such a wait , she did not answer .
" Well , Lizzy , "  his mother continued shortly thereafter ,  " and so the Collins live very well , do not they ?
Well , well , I just hope it's going to last .
And what kind of table do they keep ?
Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say .
If she is half as strong as her mother , she saves enough .
There is nothing extravagant in their household , I dare say .
" No nothing at all . " 
" A lot of good management depends on it .
Yes , yes , they will be careful not to exceed their income .
They will never be afflicted for money .
Well , as good as they do !
And so , I suppose , they often talk about having Longbourn when your father is dead .
They consider it to be theirs , I dare say , every time that happens .  " 
" It was a subject they could not mention before me . " 
" No , it would have been strange if they had done it , but I have no doubt that they often talk to each other about it .
Well , if they can be easy with a domain that does not belong to them legally , so much the better .
I should be ashamed to have one that was imposed on me only by me .
Chapter 41 The first week of their return was soon over .
The second has begun .
This was the last stay of the regiment at Meryton , and all the girls in the neighborhood were falling .
The abatement was almost universal .
The eldest , Miss Bennets , alone could still eat , drink , and sleep , and follow the usual course of her labors .
Very often they were reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not understand such hardness of heart in any family .
" Good heaven !
what will become of us ?
What do we have to do ? " 
would they have often shouted in the bitterness of misfortune .
" How can you smile , Lizzy ?
Their loving mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she herself endured on a similar occasion twenty-five years ago .
" I'm sure , "  she said ,  " I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment left .
I thought I should have broken my heart .  " 
" I'm sure I'm going to break mine , "  said Lydia .
" If only we could go to Brighton ! " 
observed Mrs. Bennet .
" Oh , yes , if only we could go to Brighton !
But daddy is so unpleasant .  " 
" A little sea bath would put me in place forever . " 
" And aunt Phillips is sure it would do me good , "  Kitty added .
Such were the lamentations that reverberated perpetually in Longbourn House .
Elizabeth tried to be hijacked by them; but all feeling of pleasure was lost in shame .
She felt the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections again; and she had never been so disposed to forgive her interference in her friend's views .
But the sadness of Lydia's perspective was soon dispelled; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster , the regimental colonel's wife , to accompany him to Brighton .
This inestimable friend was a very young woman , and very recently married .
A resemblance of good humor and good humor had recommended her to Lydia and her , and their knowledge of three months , they had been two intimate .
The abduction of Lydia on this occasion , her adoration of Mrs. Forster , the joy of Mrs. Bennet , and the mortification of Kitty , are scarcely described .
Completely inattentive to her sister's feelings , Lydia flew into the house in an agitated ecstasy , calling everyone's congratulations , laughing and speaking with more violence than ever; while the unfortunate Kitty continued in the parlor to repent of her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was sullen .
" I do not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia , "  she said ,  " though I'm not his particular friend .
I have just as much reason to be asked that she has , and more so , because I am two years older .
Elizabeth tried in vain to make her reasonable , and Jane to resign her .
As for Elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting at her the same sentiments as at her mother's and Lydia's , that she regarded it as the death-sentence of any possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable that such an approach would make her known , she could not help but secretly advise her father not to let her go .
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general conduct , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of a woman like Mme . Forster , and the probability that she would be even more reckless with such a companion . Brighton , where the temptations had to be bigger than at home .
He listened intently and said ,  " Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in a public place and we can never expect her to do so with little or no expense . disadvantages for his family only in the present circumstances .  " 
" If you were aware , "  said Elizabeth ,  " of the very great disadvantage to all of us that must come from public notice in the reckless and reckless way of Lydia - no , which has already arisen from him , I'm sure you would judge differently in the case .  " 
" Already appeared ? " 
repeated Mr. Bennet .
" What , did she scare some of your lovers ?
Poor little Lizzy !
But do not be shot .
Such young people who can not bear a little absurdity are not worth the slightest regret .
Let's see , let me see the list of the wretches who have been kept apart by the madness of Lydia .
" Indeed , you are mistaken .
I do not have such injuries to send back .
It is not peculiar , but of general ills , of which I complain now .
Our importance , our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility , the insurance and the disdain of any restraint that characterizes Lydia's character .
Excuse me , because I have to speak clearly .
If you will not , my dear father , take the trouble to check his exuberant minds and tell him that his present occupations are not the business of his life , she will soon be out of reach of the amendment .
Her character will be fixed , and at sixteen she will have the most determined flirtation that has ever made her family ridiculous; a flirt , too , in the worst and most average degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and , by ignorance and the emptiness of his mind , incapable of repelling any part of that universal contempt which his rage of admiration will excite .
In this danger Kitty is also understood .
She will follow wherever Lydia leads .
Vain , ignorant , idle and absolutely uncontrolled !
Oh !
my dear father , can you suppose that it is possible that they are not censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters are not often mixed up in disgrace ?
Mr. Bennet saw that his whole heart was in the subject , and , taking his hand affectionately , he said to him ,  " Do not worry , my love .
Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued . and you will not be less able to have two or three silly sisters .
We will not have peace in Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton .
Let her go , then .
Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will prevent him from all evil; and she is fortunately too poor to be an object of prey to anyone .
In Brighton she will have less importance , even as an ordinary flirt she has been here .
Agents will find that women are worth their attention .
Let's hope that his presence there can teach him his own insignificance .
In any case , she can not grow several degrees , without allowing us to lock her up for the rest of her life .
With this answer , Elizabeth was obliged to be satisfied; but her own opinion continued the same thing , and she left him disappointed and sorry .
However , it was not in his nature to increase his annoyances by dwelling on them .
She was sure of having done her duty , and to worry about the inevitable evils , or to increase them with anxiety , was not part of her disposition .
If Lydia and her mother had known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have been able to express itself in their united volubility .
In Lydia's imagination , a visit to Brighton included all the possibilities of earthly happiness .
She saw , with the creative eye of fantasy , the streets of this gay bathing place covered with officers .
It was the object of attention , to dozens and dozens of them at the moment unknown .
She saw all the glories of the camp , her tents stretched out in a beautiful uniformity of lines , full of young and gay , dazzling with scarlet; and , to complete the sight , she saw herself sitting under a tent , flirting tenderly with at least six officers at a time .
Had she known that her sister was trying to snatch her from such perspectives and realities , what would have been her sensations ?
They could have been understood only by his mother , who could have felt pretty much the same thing .
Lydia was going to Brighton , it was all that consoled her for her sad conviction that her husband never intended to go himself .
But they did not know everything that had happened; and their raptures continued , with little intermission , on the very day of Lydia leaving the house .
Elizabeth must now see Mr. Wickham for the last time .
Having been frequently in his company since his return , the agitation was almost complete; the agitations of the old partiality were just as much .
She had even learned to discover , in the very sweetness that had first delighted her , an affectation and a similarity of disgust and fatigue .
Moreover , in her current behavior , she felt a new source of discontent , for the inclination he soon showed to renew the intentions which had marked the first part of their knowledge could only serve , after what had happened since , to provoke it .
She lost all anxiety for him to find himself thus chosen as the object of such an idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she repressed it regularly , she could only feel the reprimand contained in her beliefs , that , whatever time it was , and for whatever reason , her attentions had withdrawn , her vanity would be satisfied , and her preference assured at all times by their renewal .
On the last day of the regiment at Meryton , he dined with other officers at Longbourn; Elizabeth was so reluctant to part with him in a good mood , that , to inquire as to how she spent her time at Hunsford , she said that Colonel Fitzwilliam and Mr. Darcy had spent three weeks at Rosings , and he asked him , if he knew first .
He looked surprised , dissatisfied , alarmed; but with a moment of recollection and a smile of return , he replied that he had seen him often before; and , after observing that he was a very gentleman , asked her how she had loved him .
His response was warmly in his favor .
With an air of indifference , he added shortly afterwards:  " How long have you said he was in Rosings ?
" Almost three weeks . " 
" And you saw him frequently ? " 
" Yes , almost every day . " 
" His manners are very different from those of his cousin . " 
" Yes , very different .
But I think Mr. Darcy is getting better .  " 
" Effectively ! " 
cried Mr. Wickham , with a look that did not escape him .
" And pray , may I ask ? "   " But checking himself , he added , in a more cheerful tone , "  Is it in the address he improves ?
Has he deigned to add anything of civility to his ordinary style ? For I dare not hope , he continued in a more serious and serious tone , that he has improved to the essentials .
" Oh not ! " 
this Elizabeth .
" In essence , I believe , he is what he has always been . " 
While she was talking , Wickham seemed not to know whether to rejoice in his words or be wary of their meaning .
There was something in her face that made her listen with anxious and anxious attention , as she added ,  " When I said that he improved knowledge , I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , to know him better , his disposition was better understood .
Wickham's alarm now appeared in an exacerbated complexion and an agitated look; he remained silent a few moments , and , shaking his embarrassment , he turned towards her and said in a gentle tone:  " You who know my feelings so well towards Mr. Darcy , I will understand with what sincerity I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right .
His pride , in this direction , may be useful , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only distract him from the bad conduct I have suffered .
I only fear that the kind of caution you are referring to , I suppose , is simply adopted during his visits to his aunt , whose good opinion and good judgment he judges .
Her fear of her always worked , I know , when they were together; and much must be attributed to his desire to dispatch the fight with Miss de Bourgh , whom I am sure he has much to heart .
Elizabeth could not repress a smile , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of her grievances , and she was in no mood to please him .
The rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of the usual gaiety , but without trying to distinguish Elizabeth; and they separated at last with a mutual civility , and perhaps a mutual desire never to see each other again .
When the party broke up , Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton , from where they had to leave early the next morning .
The separation between her and her family was noisy rather than pathetic .
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she cried of vexation and envy .
Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the happiness of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity to have fun as much as possible - the advice that there was every reason to believe would be well attended; and in the noisy happiness of Lydia herself , in bidding her farewell , the sweetest farewells of her sisters were pronounced without being heard .
Chapter 42 If Elizabeth's opinion had been drawn from her own family , she could not have had a very pleasant opinion of conjugal bliss or domestic comfort .
Her father , captivated by youth and beauty , and the generally good-natured appearance of youth and beauty , had married a woman whose understanding and illiberal spirit had soon removed any real affection for her .
Respect , esteem , and trust were gone forever; and all his views on domestic happiness were reversed .
But Mr. Bennet was not disposed to comfort himself with the disappointment which his own imprudence had caused in one of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunates with their folly or vice .
He loved the country and the books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .
For his wife , he was very indebted , and his ignorance and madness had contributed to his amusement .
This is not the kind of happiness that a man would generally want of his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are lacking , the true philosopher will profit from those given .
Elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behavior as a husband .
She had always seen him with pain; but , mindful of her abilities and grateful for her affectionate treatment , she endeavored to forget what she could not neglect , and to banish from her thoughts this continual violation of conjugal obligation and decorum which , by exposing his wife in defiance of his own children , was so highly reprehensible .
But she had never felt as strongly as now the disadvantages which the children must undergo in a marriage so unsuitable , and never so fully aware of the evils which result from a badly judged management of talents; talents who , rightly , could have at least preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if they were unable to enlarge the mind of his wife .
When Elizabeth had rejoiced at Wickham's departure , she found little cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .
Their evenings abroad were less varied than before , and at her house she had a mother and a sister , whose constant repugnance to the boredom of all that surrounded them cast a shadow over their domestic surroundings; and although Kitty could regain her sense of natural meaning over time , since the disturbances of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition the greatest evil could be apprehended , was likely to be hardened throughout her life . madness and assurance by a situation of this double danger like a trough and a camp .
On the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked with an impatient desire did not bring , in taking place , all the satisfaction she had promised herself  .
It was therefore necessary to name another period for the beginning of present happiness - to have another point on which his desires and hopes could be fixed , and still enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , to console himself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .
His tour of the Lakes was now the object of his happiest thoughts; it was his best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours that the discontent of his mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the project , each part would have been perfect .
" But he is happy , "  she thought ,  " that I have something to desire .
If all the arrangement was complete , my disappointment would be certain .
But here , taking with me an incessant source of regret in the absence of my sister , I hope reasonably able to achieve all my expectations of pleasure .
A project that each party promises joy can never succeed; and the general disappointment is repulsed only by the defense of a particular petty vexation .
When Lydia left , she promised to write very often and very carefully to her mother and Kitty; but his letters were always awaited for a long time , and always very short .
Those of his mother contained little more than the fact that they had just returned from the library , where this or that officer had followed them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments that made her mad; that she had a new dress or parasol , which she would have described in more detail , but that she was obliged to leave in haste , as Madame Forster called her , and that they went to the camp; and his correspondence with his sister , there was even less to learn , for his letters to Kitty , though longer , were too full of lines under the words to be made public .
After the first fortnight or three weeks of his absence , health , good humor and good humor began to reappear in Longbourn .
Everything had a happier aspect .
The families who were in town for the winter came back , and the summer dress and the summer engagements rose .
Mrs. Bennet has been restored to her usual quarrelsome serenity; and in mid-June Kitty was so well recovered that she could enter Meryton without tears; an event of such a happy promise that Elizabeth hopes that by the following Christmas she might be reasonable enough not to talk about an officer over a time per day , unless , by a cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office , another regiment is stationed at Meryton .
The hour set for the beginning of their tour in the north was rapidly approaching , and there was only a fortnight left when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner , which delayed its commencement and reduced its extent .
Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from leaving a fortnight later , in July , and he should be back in London in a month , and that left them too little time to go so far , and see so many things that They had been proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built , they were forced to abandon the Lakes and to substitute a more contracted tour , and , according to the current plan , were not to to go further than Derbyshire .  .
In this county , there was enough to see to occupy the head of their three weeks; and Mrs. Gardiner had a particularly strong attraction .
The city where she had spent a few years of her life , and where they would spend a few days , was probably an object of her curiosity as much as all the famous beauties of Matlock , Chatsworth , Dovedale , or Pic .
Elizabeth was exceedingly disappointed; she had set her heart to see the lakes , and still thought there might have been enough time .
But it was his business to satisfy - and certainly his character to be happy; and everything was going to be right again soon .
With the mention of Derbyshire , there were a lot of related ideas .
It was impossible for him to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and his owner .
" But , assuredly , "  she said ,  " I can enter his county with impunity and rob him of some petrified spars without him noticing me .
The waiting period was now doubled .
Four weeks had passed before his uncle and aunt arrived .
But they died , and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , with their four children , finally appeared at Longbourn .
The children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane , who was the general favorite , and whose constant sense and gentleness of character suited her exactly to them in every way - teach them , play with them , and love them .
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn and left the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .
Enjoyment was certain-that of the propriety of companions; a propriety that included health and temperament to withstand the inconveniences - gaiety to enhance all pleasures - and affection and intelligence , which could furnish it between them if there were disappointments abroad .
It is not the object of this work to describe Derbyshire , nor any of the remarkable places by which their route was; Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenilworth , Birmingham , etc .
are sufficiently known .
A small part of Derbyshire is all the current concern .
In the little town of Lambton , where Madame Gardiner's former residence still stood , and where she had learned some acquaintances , they bent over , after having seen all the principal marvels of the country; and five miles from Lambton , Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated .
It was not on their direct route , nor more than a mile or two away .
Speaking of their journey the day before , Ms . Gardiner expressed her desire to revisit the place .
Mr. Gardiner declared his will , and Elizabeth was asked for his approval .
" My love , would not you like to see a place you've heard so much about ?
said his aunt;  " A place too , with which so much of your knowledge is connected .
Wickham spent all his youth there , you know .
Elizabeth was in distress .
She felt she had nothing to do with Pemberley and was obliged to be reluctant to see him .
She must admit that she was tired of seeing big houses; after spending so much , she really had no pleasure in beautiful carpets or satin curtains .
Ms . Gardiner abused her stupidity .
" If it were a beautiful , richly furnished house , "  she said ,  " I would not care for it myself , but the land is charming .
They have some of the most beautiful woods in the country .  " 
Elizabeth said no more - but her mind could not acquiesce .
The opportunity to meet Mr. Darcy , while looking at the place , occurred instantly .
It would be terrible !
She blushed at the thought itself , and thought it was better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk .
But against that there were objections; and she finally decided that he could be the last resource , if his private requests to the family's absence were unfavorably answered .
As a result , when she retired at night , she asked the maid if Pemberley was not a place very well ?
what was the name of its owner ?
and , without worry , if the family was down for the summer ?
The last question was followed by a welcome negative - and her alarms being now lifted , she had plenty of time to see the house itself; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again solicited , she could easily answer , and with an air of suitable indifference , that she had no real aversion to the project .
For Pemberley , therefore , they had to leave .
Chapter 43 Elizabeth , while they were driving , looked for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some disruption; and when at last they returned to the box , his minds were in a high beat .
The park was very large and contained a wide variety of terrain .
They entered one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood that extended over a wide expanse .
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable point and point of view .
They climbed gradually for half a mile , then found themselves at the top of a considerable hill , where the wood stopped , and the eye was immediately taken by the Pemberley house , situated on the other side of a valley , in which the road with a sharp injury .
It was a large and handsome stone building , erected on a high ground and supported by a ridge of high wooded hills; and forward , a current of some natural importance was inflated in larger , but without any artificial aspect .
His banks were neither formal nor falsely ornamented .
Elizabeth was delighted .
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where the natural beauty had been so little counteracted by a clumsy taste .
They were all hot in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that becoming Pemberley's mistress could be something !
They went down the hill , crossed the bridge , and made their way to the door; and , while examining the nearest aspect of the house , all his apprehension to meet his owner returned .
She was afraid that the maid would be mistaken .
By asking to see the place , they were admitted into the room; and Elizabeth , while waiting for the governess , had the leisure to ask herself where she was .
The cleaning lady has come; an elderly woman of respectable appearance , much less fine and more civil , whom she had no idea of ​​finding her .
They followed her into the dining room .
It was a large well proportioned room , superbly appointed .
Elizabeth , after having slightly examined her , went to a window to appreciate her perspective .
The hill , crowned with wood , which they had descended , receiving a sudden increase of the distance , was a beautiful object .
Every disposition of the earth was good; and she looked at the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as it could trace it , with delights .
When passing through other rooms , these objects took different positions; but from each window there were beauties to see .
The rooms were tall and beautiful , and their furniture suited the fortune of its owner; but Elizabeth saw , with admiration of her taste , that she was neither brilliant nor uselessly beautiful; with less splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of Rosings .
" And from this place , "  she thought ,  " I could have been a mistress !
With these pieces , I may have already been familiar !
Instead of seeing them as a stranger , I would perhaps have rejoiced in them as mine , and I welcomed them as my uncle and my aunt .
But no , remembering herself , it could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them .  " 
It was a lucky memory - it saved her from something that looked like regret .
She wanted to ask the governess if her master was really absent , but did not have the courage .
In the long run , however , the question was asked by his uncle; and she turned away frightened , while Mrs. Reynolds answered that he was , adding:  " But we are waiting for him tomorrow , with a large group of friends .
What joy did Elizabeth have to see that their own journey had in no way been delayed by a day !
Her aunt called her now to look at a picture .
She approached and saw the resemblance of Mr. Wickham suspended among several other miniatures , above the fireplace .
Her aunt smiled at her how she liked it .
The housekeeper stepped forward and told them it was a picture of a young man , the son of the steward of his late master , who had been brought up by him at his own expense .
He has now entered the army ,  " she added;  " but I'm afraid it turned out to be very wild . " 
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but Elizabeth could not return it .
" And that , "  said Mrs. Reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures ,  " is my master - and looks a lot like him .
It was drawn at the same time as the other - about eight years ago .
" I've heard a lot of good people from your master , "  Gardiner said , looking at the picture;  " It's a beautiful face .
But , Lizzy , can you tell us if it's like or not ?
Mrs. Reynolds' respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .
" Does this girl know Mr.
Darcy ?
Elizabeth colored and said ,  " A little bit . " 
" And you do not find him a handsome gentleman , madame ?
" Yes very nice . " 
I'm sure I do not know such beautiful , but in the gallery , on the stairs , you'll see a picture more beautiful and larger of him than this one .
This piece was the favorite piece of my late master , and these miniatures are exactly what they were at the time .
He loved them very much .  " 
It represented Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham being among them .
Ms . Reynolds then drew their attention to one of Ms . Darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old .
" And is Miss Darcy as beautiful as her brother ? " 
Mrs. Gardiner said .
" Oh !
yes - the most beautiful girl we have ever seen; and if accomplished ! - She plays and sings all day .
In the next room , a new instrument has just come down for her - a gift from my master; she's coming here tomorrow with him .
Mr. Gardiner , whose manners were very easy and agreeable , encouraged his communication by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds , either out of pride or attachment , obviously had much pleasure in talking about her master and sister .
" Is your master in Pemberley during the year ? " 
" Not as much as I would like , sir , but I dare say he can spend half of his time here , and Miss Darcy is always there for the summer months .
" Except , "  Elizabeth thought ,  " when she's going to Ramsgate . " 
" If your master gets married , you could see more of him . " 
- Yes , sir , but I do not know when it will be .
I do not know who is good enough for him .  " 
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled .
Elizabeth could not help saying ,  " I'm sure it's to his credit that you should think so . " 
I do not say more than the truth , and everyone will say who knows it ,  " answered the other .
Elizabeth thought it was far enough; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added ,  " I have never known a crossword from him in my life , and I've known him since he was four years old . " 
It was the praise of all the others , the most extraordinary , the most opposed to his ideas .
That he was not a man of good humor had been his firmest opinion .
His keenest attention has been awakened; she wanted to know more and was grateful to her uncle for saying ,  " There are very few people to whom so much can be said .
You're lucky to have such a master .
" Yes , sir , I know I am .
If I had to cross the world , I could not meet better .
But I have always observed that those who are good when they are children have a good nature when they grow up; and he was still the sweetest and most generous boy in the world .  " 
Elizabeth was almost looking at her .
" Can it be M .
Darcy ?
she thought .
" His father was an excellent man , "  Gardiner said .
" Yes , ma'am , that he was indeed , and his son will be like him , just as affable to the poor . " 
Elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more .
Mrs. Reynolds could not interest him in any other way .
She told in vain the subjects of the paintings , the dimensions of the pieces and the price of the furniture .
Mr. Gardiner , much amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed his excessive praise to his master , soon returned to the subject; and she lived energetically on her many merits as they climbed the grand staircase together .
" He is the best owner and the best master , "  she says ,  " who has ever lived , and no longer like wild young people who think only of themselves .
There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name .
Some people call it proud; but I'm sure I have never seen anything .
For my taste , it's only because he does not complain like other young men .
" In what kind light does he place it ! " 
thinks Elizabeth .
" This beautiful story of him , "  murmured his aunt as he walked ,  " is not entirely in keeping with his behavior towards our poor friend .
" Maybe we could be deceived . " 
" It's not very likely , our authority was too good . " 
Arriving in the spacious hall above , we discovered a very nice living room , recently furnished with more elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and it was learned that it was only to please Miss Darcy , who had taken a liking to the room when she had last come to Pemberley .
" He's definitely a good brother , "  said Elizabeth , as she walked to one of the windows .
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's pleasure when she should enter the room .
" And it's always the way with him , "  she added .
" Anything that can bring pleasure to your sister is sure to be done in a moment .
There is nothing he would not do for her .  " 
The picture gallery and two or three of the main rooms were all that was left to show .
In the first were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of art; and what had already been visible below , she had voluntarily turned to look at Miss Darcy's drawings , in colored pencils , whose subjects were generally more interesting , and also more intelligible .
In the gallery there were many family portraits , but they might have little to fix the attention of a stranger .
Elizabeth walked in search of the only face whose features would be known to her .
At last she stopped him - and she saw a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy , with such a smile on her face that she remembered having sometimes seen when he was looking at her .
She stood a few minutes before the picture , in serious contemplation , and returned before leaving the gallery .
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken during her father's life .
There was certainly in Elizabeth's mind a softer feeling for the original than she had ever felt at the height of their knowledge .
Mrs. Reynolds' recommendation to her was not insignificant .
What praise is worth more than the praise of a clever servant ?
As a brother , owner , master , she considered the happiness of many people under her tutelage - what pleasure or suffering was it in her power to give ? - what part of good or bad had to be done by him !
All the ideas advanced by the governess were favorable to her character , and , as she stood before the canvas on which he was depicted , and fixed her eyes upon her , she thought of her esteem with a feeling of gratitude deeper than she did not have any . never raised before; she remembered her warmth and softened her impropriety of expression .
When the whole house opened for general inspection was seen , they went back downstairs , and , taking leave of the governess , were entrusted to the gardener who met them at the door of the vestibule .
As they crossed the corridor towards the river , Elizabeth turned to look again; his uncle and aunt also stopped , and while the first conjectured the date of the building , the proprietor himself advanced abruptly from the road which led to the stable .
They were twenty paces from each other , and his appearance was so abrupt that it was impossible to avoid his sight .
Their eyes met instantly , and their cheeks were covered with the deepest blush .
He began absolutely , and for a moment seemed motionless of surprise; but recovering soon , advanced towards the party , and spoke to Elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect calm , at least perfect civility .
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping at his approach , received his compliments from an embarrassment impossible to conquer .
If his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just examined , was insufficient to assure the two others that they were now seeing M . Darcy , the gardener's expression of surprise , on seeing his master , was due to him . say immediately .
They remained a little apart while he spoke to their niece , who , astonished and confused , dared to raise her eyes to her face , and did not know what answer she was referring to her civil inquiries after her family .
Astonished at the alteration of his manners since the last separation , every sentence he pronounced increased his embarrassment; and every thought of the inconvenience of being found there came back to his mind , the few minutes they continued were among the most uncomfortable of his life .
He did not seem comfortable either; when he spoke , his accent had nothing of his usual seduction; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time when she had left Longbourn , and of her having remained in Derbyshire , so often , and so hastily , as the distraction of her thoughts clearly spoke .
At the end , every idea seemed to fail him; and , after a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly remembered and took his leave .
The others joined her then and expressed their admiration for her figure; but Elizabeth did not hear a word , and , absorbed by her own feelings , followed them in silence .
She was restrained by shame and vexation .
His coming there was the most unfortunate thing , the most badly judged in the world !
How strange it must sound to him !
In what shameful light would he not strike such a vain man !
It might seem like she's deliberately thrown herself back on her way !
Oh !
why did she come ?
Or , why did he come a day before he was expected ?
Had they been only ten minutes earlier , they should have been out of reach of discrimination; for it was clear that it was that moment arrived - that moment came down from his horse or his car .
She blushes again and again on the perversity of the meeting .
And his behavior , so singularly altered , what could it mean ?
That he should even talk to him was amazing ! But to speak with so much civility , to inquire about his family !
Never in her life had she seen her unworthy ways , never had he spoken so softly as at this unexpected meeting .
What a contrast he offered to his last address at Rosings Park , when he put his letter in his hand !
She did not know what to think , nor how to report .
They had now entered a beautiful promenade at the water's edge , and each step brought a nobler fall of ground , or a better reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it took some time before Elizabeth was sensible of it; and , although she answered mechanically to the repeated calls of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they indicated , she did not distinguish any part of the scene .
His thoughts were all fixed on this place of Pemberley House , whoever he was , where was Mr. Darcy then .
She wanted to know what was happening right now in her mind - how he was thinking about her , and if , in spite of everything , she was still dear to him .
Perhaps he had only been civil because he felt comfortable; yet there was in his voice what was not like ease .
If he had felt more pain or pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her in cold blood .
In the end , however , her companions' remarks about her lack of spirit excited her , and she felt the need to look more like her .
They entered the woods , and for a moment they bid farewell to the river and climbed to the heights; when , in the places where the opening of the trees gave the power of wandering , there were many charming views over the valley , the opposite hills , with the long expanse of wood that extended over many , and sometimes on a part of the creek .
Mr. Gardiner expressed the desire to go all over the park , but he feared it would be beyond a walk .
With a triumphant smile , they are told that it was ten miles round .
He settled the case; and they continued the regular circuit; which brought them back , after some time , in a descent among the hanging woods , at the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts .
They crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene; it was a place less ornate than the one they had visited; and the valley , here contracted in a valley , allowed only the place for the brook , and a narrow walk in the midst of the coppices which bordered it .
Elizabeth longed to explore her windings; but when they had crossed the bridge and noticed their distance from the house , Mrs. Gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no further , and only thought of returning to the car as soon as possible .  .
Her niece was obliged to submit , and they went to the house on the other side of the river , in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow , for Mr. Gardiner , though rarely capable of tasting the taste , liked fishing very much , and was so busy watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man at their subject , which he has advanced but little .
While wandering in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what he had been at first , at the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them , and at a little distance .
The walk here being less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see it before they met .
Elizabeth , astonished as she was , was at least better prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and speak calmly , if he really intended to meet them .
For a few moments , indeed , she felt that he was probably going to take another path .
The idea lasted while a detour in the walk hid it from their sight; the past turning , he was immediately before them .
At a glance , she saw that he had lost nothing of his recent civility; and , to imitate her politeness , she began , by meeting , to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not overstepped the words  " charming "  and  " charming "  when some unlucky memories occurred , and she believed that Pemberley's eulogy of her might be misunderstood .
Her color changed , and she did not say more .
Ms . Gardiner stood a little behind; and on his break , he asked her if she would do him the honor of introducing him to his friends .
It was a courtesy for which she was not prepared; and she could barely suppress a smile to her being now seeking knowledge of some of those same people against whom her pride had revolted in her offer to herself .
" What will be her surprise , "  she thought ,  " when will he know who they are ?
He now takes them for fashion people .  " 
The introduction , however , was made immediately; and as she named their relationship to herself , she looked at him with cunning , to see how he wore it , and was not without the expectation of his being decamped as soon as possible from those shameful companions .
That he was surprised by the connection was obvious; he , however , supported him with courage , and , far from departing , turned with them and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner .
Elizabeth could only rejoice , could only triumph .
It was comforting to know that she had relationships that could not be blushed .
She listened attentively to all that was passing between them , and boasted in all the expressions , in all the phrases of her uncle , which marked her intelligence , her taste , or her manners .
The conversation soon turned to fishing; and she heard M . Darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he wished while he continued in the neighborhood , offering him at the same time to furnish him with fishing articles and to show the parts of the creek where there was usually the most sport .
Mrs. Gardiner , who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth , gave her an expressive look of wonder .
Elizabeth said nothing , but she gratified her excessively; the compliment must be everything for itself .
Her astonishment , however , was extreme , and she continued to repeat ,  " Why is he so altered ?
What can he do ?
It can not be for me , it is not for me that his manners are thus softened .
My reprimands in Hunsford could not make such a change .
It is impossible that he still loved me .
After walking for some time , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , resuming their place , after having descended to the edge of the river to better inspect a curious aquatic plant , it turned out that there was a slight alteration .  .
It came from Mrs. Gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support and , therefore , preferred her husband's .
Mr. Darcy took his place near his niece and they walked together .
After a short silence , the lady first spoke .
She wanted to let her know that she had been assured of her absence before she came to the place , and as a result began watching , that her arrival had been very unexpected -  " for your housekeeper , "  she said . added ,  " informed us that we will certainly not be here until tomorrow , and besides , before leaving Bakewell , we realized that you were not expected right away in the countryside .
He recognized the truth of all this , and said that the affairs with his steward had occasioned his coming a few hours before the rest of the party with which he had traveled .
" They will join me tomorrow morning , "  he continued ,  " and among them there are some who claim to be you , Mr. Bingley and his sisters .
Elizabeth answered only with a slight bow .
His thoughts were immediately brought back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name was last mentioned among them; and if she could judge by her complexion , her mind was not very differently engaged .
" There is also another person in the group , "  he continued after a break ,  " who wants to know you better .
Do you allow me , or did I ask too much , to introduce my sister to you during your stay in Lambton ?
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too much for her to know how she accessed it .
She felt at once that Miss Darcy's desire to know her must have been the work of her brother , and , without looking further , it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that her resentment had not made her really sick of her .
They walked now in silence , each of them deeply in thought .
Elizabeth was not comfortable; it was impossible; but she was flattered and happy .
His desire to introduce his sister to him was a compliment of the highest kind .
They soon passed the others , and when they got to the car , Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a mile behind .
He then asked her to enter the house - but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn .
A lot could have been said then , and the silence was very embarrassing .
She wanted to talk , but there seemed to be an embargo on all subjects .
Finally , she remembered that she was traveling , and they talked about Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance .
However , time and aunt were moving slowly - and his patience and ideas were almost exhausted before the end of the tete-a-tete .
At the approach of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , they were all in a hurry to go into the house and take a refreshment; but this was refused , and they separated on each side with the greatest politeness .
Mr. Darcy put the ladies back in the car; and when he left , Elizabeth saw him walk slowly toward the house .
The observations of his uncle and aunt began now; and each of them declared it infinitely superior to all that they expected .
" He is perfectly well behaved , polite and unpretentious , "  said his uncle .
" There is something a little majestic about him , of course , "  replied his aunt ,  " but she is confined to her air , and not unseemly .
I can now tell the cleaning lady that although some people may call her proud , I have not seen anything .
" I have never been more surprised than by his behavior .
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no need for such attention .
His knowledge of Elizabeth was very insignificant .  " 
" To be sure , Lizzy , "  said his aunt ,  " he is not so handsome as Wickham , or rather he does not have Wickham's face , for his features are perfectly good .
But how could you tell me that he was so unpleasant ?
Elizabeth apologized as well as she could; said that she had loved him better when they had met in Kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning .
" But maybe he can be a little fanciful in his civility , "  replied his uncle .
" Your great men are often so , and I will not take him at his word , for he might change his mind another day and warn me of his lands .
Elizabeth felt that they had completely misunderstood her character , but said nothing .
" From what we've seen of him , "  Gardiner continued ,  " I really should not have thought that he could have behaved so cruelly by someone as he did by poor Wickham .
He does not look bad .
On the contrary , there is something pleasant in his mouth when he speaks .
And there is something dignified in his face that would not give an unfavorable impression of his heart .
But , of course , the good lady who showed us her house gave her a more flamboyant character !
I could hardly help but laugh aloud sometimes .
But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and in the eye of a servant he understands all the virtues .
Elizabeth felt called to say something to justify her behavior towards Wickham; and thus gave them to understand , in the most prudent manner possible , that by what she had heard of her relations in Kent , her acts were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so defective , nor Wickham is so amiable , as they had been considered in Hertfordshire .
To confirm this , she recounted the details of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been linked , without naming her authority , but stating that it could be invoked .
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and worried; but , at the approach of his first pleasures , each idea gave way to the charm of memory; and she was too busy showing her husband all the interesting places in her surroundings to think of something else .
Tired as she had been in the morning walk , she had hardly dined before she went back in search of her old acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a renewed relationship after many years of interruption .  .
The events of the day were too intense to allow Elizabeth to attract the attention of these new friends; and she could only think , and think with astonishment , at the politeness of M . Darcy , and especially at his desire to know his sister .
Chapter 44 Elizabeth had decided that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister the same day after she had reached Pemberley; and was therefore resolved not to be out of sight of the inn all morning .
But his conclusion was false; for the very next day they arrived at Lambton these visitors came .
They were walking with their new friends and returning to the hostel to get dressed with the same family , when the sound of a car drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving the street .
Elizabeth , immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what she wanted to say and left no little surprise to her relations by making them know the honor she expected .
His uncle and aunt were all astonished; and the embarrassment of her manners as she spoke , coupled with the circumstance herself , and with many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea of ​​affairs .
Nothing had ever suggested it before , but they felt that there was no other way to account for such attentions of such a neighborhood than assuming a partiality for their niece .
While these new ideas were born in their heads , the disturbance of Elizabeth's feelings increased every moment .
She was surprised at his own distraction; but , among other causes of anxiety , she feared that the brother's partiality had said too much in his favor; and , more than ordinarily desirous of pleasing , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her .
She retired from the window , fearing to be seen; and while she was walking about the room , trying to recover herself , she saw in her uncle and aunt such curious looks of surprise that everything was getting worse .
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared , and this wonderful introduction took place .
Amazingly , Elizabeth saw that her new acquaintance was at least as embarrassed as herself .
Since she had been at Lambton , she had learned that Miss Darcy was extremely proud; but the observation of a few minutes convinced her that she was only very timid .
She found it difficult to get even a word from her beyond a monosyllable one .
Miss Darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and , although a little over sixteen , her face was formed , and her appearance feminine and gracious .
She was less beautiful than her brother; but there was sense and good humor in his face , and his manners were perfectly modest and sweet .
Elizabeth , who was expecting to find an observer as acute and harmless as she had ever been in Darcy , was very relieved to discern such different feelings .
They had not been together long before Mr. Darcy told him that Bingley was coming to wait for him too; and she had scarcely time to express her satisfaction , and to prepare herself for such a visitor , when Bingley took a quick step up the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room .
All Elizabeth's anger against him had long been abolished; but if she had still felt it , she would hardly have been able to resist the unchanged cordiality with which he was expressing himself by seeing her again .
He inquired in a friendly , though general way , after his family , and looked and spoke with the same good humor he had ever made .
For Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , he was hardly a less interesting person than for herself .
They had long wanted to see him .
The whole party before them , indeed , excited a keen attention .
The suspicions which had just arisen from Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each of them with a serious but prudent investigation; and they soon derived from these inquiries the full conviction that at least one of them knew what it was to love .
Feelings of the lady , they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was quite evident .
Elizabeth , meanwhile , had a lot to do .
She wanted to know the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose his own and make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter case , where she feared the most to miss , she was sure of success , for those to whom she sought to please were warned in her favor .
Bingley was ready , Georgiana was impatient , and Darcy determined , to be happy .
Upon seeing Bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and , oh !
how eagerly she wanted to know if one of her sisters was being led in the same way .
Sometimes she could imagine that he spoke less than in the past , and once or twice thought that , looking at her , he was trying to find a resemblance .
But , though it may be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to her behavior to Miss Darcy , who had been set up as Jane's rival .
No look appeared on both sides that spoke of a particular look .
Nothing was going on between them that could justify the hopes of his sister .
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred before their separation , which , in his anxious interpretation , denoted a memory of Jane , not without tenderness by tenderness , and a desire to say more which could lead to the mention of her , he had dared .
He was watching her , at a time when the others were talking together , and in a tone that had something really regrettable , that  " it had been a long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her " ; and , before she could answer , he added ,  " He's over eight months old .
We have not met since November 26 , when we were dancing together in Netherfield .  " 
Elizabeth was happy to find her memory so exact; and later , he took the opportunity to ask him , without being authorized by any of the others , if all his sisters were at Longbourn .
There was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a way that made sense to them .
It was not often that she could look at Mr. Darcy himself; but every time she saw him , she saw an expression of general indulgence , and in all that he said she heard an accent so detached from the height or disdain of her companions , that she convinced her that the improvement of morals which she had witnessed yesterday , however temporary , which her existence might prove , had at least survived one day .
When she saw him thus seeking to know and woo the good opinion of the people with whom a few months ago , it would have been shameful to see him , when she saw him thus civil , not only for her , but for the very relations that he had had . openly scorned , and remembered their last animated scene in Hunsford Parsonage - the difference , the change was so big , and struck so hard in her mind , that she could barely restrain her astonishment from being visible .
Never , even in the company of her dear friends from Netherfield , nor her worthy parents in Rosings , had she seen him so eager to please , so free from all consequences or restraint , as now , when success could not give it importance . of his efforts , and yet the knowledge of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw ridicule and censure from the ladies of both Netherfield and Rosings .
Their visitors stayed with them for half an hour; and when they got up to leave , Mr. Darcy invited his sister to join him in expressing their desire to see Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner , and Miss Bennet , dine at Pemberley , before leaving the country .
Miss Darcy , though with a mistrust which scarcely marked her in the habit of giving invitations , willingly obeyed .
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece , eager to know how she , who the most concerned invitation , felt disposed to accept , but Elizabeth had turned her head away .
Assuming , however , that this studied escape spoke rather of a momentary embarrassment than of any aversion to the proposition , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect will to accept it , she ventured to ask for her presence  , and the next day the next was fixed on .
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again , having much more to say to her , and many requests to make after all their friends from Hertfordshire .
Elizabeth , wishing to hear him speak of her sister , was pleased , and so , as well as others , found themselves , when their visitors left them , able to consider with satisfaction the last half-hour . but as he passed , the enjoyment had been minimal .
Eager to be alone , and fearing questions or advice from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them long enough to hear their favorable opinion of Bingley , then hurried to get dressed .
But she had no reason to fear the curiosity of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner; it was not their wish to force his communication .
It was evident that she knew Mr. Darcy much better than he had ever imagined; it was obvious that he was very in love with her .
They saw a lot of interest , but nothing to justify the investigation .
From Mr. Darcy , it was now disturbing to think well; and , to the extent that their knowledge has reached , there was no fault to be found .
They could not be spared by his politeness; and if they had drawn his character from their own feelings and from the report of his servant , without any reference to any other account , the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized him for Mr. Darcy .
There was now an interest in believing the governess; and they soon became aware that the authority of a servant who had known him since the age of four , and whose manners indicated respectability , should not be hastily rejected .
There was nothing either in the intelligence of their friends at Lambton , which could materially diminish his weight .
They had nothing to reproach him but pride; the pride he probably had , and if not , he would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small village where the family did not visit .
It was recognized , however , that he was a liberal man , and did a lot of good among the poor .
With regard to Wickham , the travelers quickly realized that he was not held in great esteem; for though the chief of his interest with his boss's son was imperfectly understood , it was well known that , on leaving Derbyshire , he had left behind a great deal of debt , which Mr. Darcy had later discharged .
As for Elizabeth , her thoughts were at Pemberley tonight more than the last; and in the evening , although it seemed long , he was not long enough to determine his feelings towards the one in this manor; and she remained awake for two whole hours trying to get them out .
She certainly did not hate him .
No; hatred had vanished for a long time , and she had been almost ashamed of ever having an aversion to him , which might be called so .
The respect created by the conviction of his precious qualities , although at first involuntarily admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to his sentiment; and he was now brought up in a somewhat more friendly nature , by witness so strongly in his favor , and putting forth his disposition in such a kind light , which yesterday had produced .
But above all , above respect and esteem , there was in her a motive of good will that could not be neglected .
It was gratitude; gratitude , not only for having once loved it , but for loving it still enough to forgive him all the bitterness and acrimony of his rejection , and all the unjust accusations that accompanied his rejection .
He who had been persuaded to avoid him as his greatest enemy , seemed , in this accidental encounter , the most eager to preserve knowledge , and without any indiscreet display of consideration , or any particularity of manner , where both they alone were anxious , solicited the good opinion of her friends , and wished to make her known to her sister .
Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude - for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed; and as such , her impression on her was of a kind to encourage , as not at all unpleasant , although it can not be exactly defined .
She respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his well-being; and she only wanted to know how far she wanted well-being to depend on herself , and how much it would be for the happiness of the two that she would use the power she still left him to give her . the renewal . of his addresses .
It had been agreed in the evening between the aunt and the niece , a politeness as striking as that of Miss Darcy , coming to see them the very day of her arrival at Pemberley , because she had only reached him for a breakfast late . to be imitated , though it can not be equaled , by a certain politeness on their side; and , therefore , it would be very useful to wait for him at Pemberley the next morning .
They had to leave .
Elizabeth was happy; but when she wondered why , she had very little to say in response .
Mr. Gardiner left them shortly after breakfast .
The fishing plan had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement was made with his meeting with some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon .
Chapter 45 Convinced that Elizabeth was now that Miss Bingley's aversion was born of jealousy , she could not help but feel how much her appearance at Pemberley was to be for her , and she was curious to know how much Courtesy this woman now be renewed .
On reaching the house , they were led into the salon by the vestibule , whose northern aspect made it delicious for the summer .
Its windows opening on the ground , admired a most refreshing view of the high wooded hills behind the house , and beautiful Spanish oaks and chestnuts that were scattered on the intermediate lawn .
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy , who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in London .
Georgiana's reception was very civil , but attended with all the embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and fear of doing evil , would easily give those who felt inferior the belief of being proud and reserved .
However , Mrs. Gardiner and her niece did her justice and complained .
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a reverence; and , while sitting , a pause , clumsy as such breaks must always be , has succeeded for a few moments .
She was at first broken by Mrs. Annesley , a distinguished and pleasant-looking woman , whose effort to introduce a sort of discourse proved to her that she was more well educated than the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner , with the occasional help of Elizabeth , the conversation was continued .
Miss Darcy seemed to want enough courage to join her; and sometimes ventured a short sentence when there was the least danger of being heard .
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to Miss Darcy , without attracting her attention .
This observation would not have prevented him from trying to speak to them if they had not been seated at an awkward distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .
His own thoughts were using it .
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen enter the room .
She wished , she feared that the master of the house might be among them; and if she wished it or feared it the most , she could hardly determine .
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice , Elizabeth was awakened when she received a cold inquiry from her after the health of her family .
She replied with indifference and brevity , and the other said nothing .
The following variation that their visit provided was produced by the entry of the servants with the cold meat , the cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits of season; but this only happened after much of a meaningful glance and a smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given to him , to remind him of his post .
There was now a job for the whole party - because even though they could not all talk , they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches soon gathered them around the table .
While she was thus engaged , Elizabeth had a good opportunity of deciding whether she feared or desired as much as possible the appearance of Mr. Darcy , by the sentiments which had led him to enter the room; and then , a moment before , she had thought she wanted to predominate , and she began to regret having come .
He had spent some time with Mr. Gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen of the house , was engaged by the river , and only left him when he heard that the ladies of the family wanted to go to Georgiana this morning -the .
Hardly did it appear that Elizabeth resolved to be perfectly easy and without embarrassment; a more necessary resolution to make , but perhaps not easier to hold , because she saw that everyone's suspicions were awake against them , and that there was hardly an eye that did not look at her behavior when he entered the room .
In no physiognomy was the attentive curiosity of Miss Bingley , notwithstanding the smiles which pervaded her face every time she spoke to one of her objects; for jealousy had not yet rendered her desperate , and her attentions to M . Darcy were far from over .
Miss Darcy , at the entrance of her brother , practiced much more to speak , and Elizabeth saw that it was important for her sister and herself to get to know each other and make as much as possible any attempt at conversation on either side .
Miss Bingley saw all that; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity to say , with a sneering politeness ,  " Pray , Miss Eliza , is not the Shire militia removed to Meryton ? " 
They must be a great loss for your family .  " 
In Darcy's presence she did not dare to mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth immediately understood that he was the highest in his thoughts; and the various memories attached to him gave him a moment of distress; but , striving vigorously to repel the evil attack , she answered the question in a rather detached tone .
As she spoke , an involuntary glance showed Darcy , with an intensified complexion , looking at her earnestly , and her sister overcome with confusion and unable to look up .
If Miss Bingley had known what pain she was giving then to her beloved friend , she would probably have abstained from the allusion; but she had only intended to dissolve Elizabeth by presenting to her the idea of ​​a man to whom she thought she was biased , to betray her a sensibility which might wound her in the opinion of Darcy , and perhaps to remind her this one all the follies and absurdities by which part of his family was linked to this body .
Never had a syllable reached him from Mademoiselle Darcy's meditative abduction .
No creature had been revealed , where secrecy was possible except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's reports , his brother was particularly eager to conceal it , from the very desire that Elizabeth had long attributed to him , to eventually become his own .
He had certainly formed such a plan , and without saying that it would affect his effort to separate him from Miss Bennet , it is probable that this might add something to his keen concern for the welfare of his friend .
Elizabeth's collected behavior , however , soon calmed her emotion; and as Miss Bingley , annoyed and disappointed , did not dare to approach Wickham , Georgiana recovered in time , but not enough to be able to speak further .
Her brother , whom she feared to meet the eye , scarcely remembered her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to divert her thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to fix them more and more happily .
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer mentioned above; and while Mr. Darcy accompanied them to their car , Miss Bingley vented her feelings by criticizing Elizabeth's person , behavior , and clothing .
But Georgiana would not join her .
His brother's recommendation was sufficient to assure him his favor; his judgment could not wander .
And he had spoken in terms of Elizabeth as leaving Georgiana without being able to find her otherwise than beautiful and kind .
When Darcy returned to the living room , Miss Bingley could not help but repeat to her some of what she had said to her sister .
" As Miss Eliza Bennet is very ill this morning , Mr. Darcy , "  she cried;  " Never in my life have I seen anyone as altered as she has been since the winter .
She has become so brown and rude !
Louisa and I agreed that we should not have known her again .
As little as Mr. Darcy would have liked such an address , he contented himself with answering coldly that he saw no other alteration than to be rather tanned , not a miraculous consequence of traveling in summer .
" For my part , "  she went on ,  " I must confess that I have never seen beauty in her .
His face is too thin; his complexion has no luster; and his features are not at all beautiful .
His nose wants character - there is nothing marked in his lines .
His teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way; and as for his eyes , which have sometimes been called so beautiful , I shall never see anything extraordinary .
They have a sharp and cunning look , which I do not like at all; and in its very air , there is self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable .  " 
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth , it was not the best method to recommend herself; but angry people are not always wise; and seeing him finally a little annoyed , she had all the success she expected .
However , he resolved to keep quiet , and , wanting to make him speak , she continued:  " I remember when we first met her in Hertfordshire , as we were all astonished to find that she was a beauty reputed , and I particularly remember You say one night , having dined at Netherfield , that she is beautiful , I should call her mother a spirit .
But then she seemed to get better , and I think you found her pretty pretty at the same time .
" Yes , "  said Darcy , who could no longer contain herself , but it was only when I first saw her , for it has been several months since I considered her one of the most beautiful women in my life . knowledge .
He then left , and Miss Bingley was left to the satisfaction of having forced her to say what was causing her grief only to herself .
Ms . Gardiner and Elizabeth talked about everything that happened during their visit , on their return , except for what they were particularly interested in .
The look and behavior of everyone they saw was discussed , except for the person who had most caught their attention .
They talked about his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit - everything but himself; Still , Elizabeth was eager to know what Gardiner thought of him , and Mrs. Gardiner would have been very gratified by the beginning of her niece .
Chapter 46 Elizabeth had been very disappointed not to find a letter from Jane when they arrived in Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed for every morning that had passed there; but the third , his revolt was over , and his sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been dissolved elsewhere .
Elizabeth was not surprised , for Jane had written the remarkably sickly direction .
They had just prepared to walk as the letters arrived; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to savor them quietly , leaving alone .
Whoever disagrees must first be treated; it was written five days ago .
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country offered; but the last half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave the intelligence more important .
It was to this effect:  " Since I wrote the above , my dear Lizzy , something more unexpected and serious happened , but I'm afraid to alarm you , rest assured that we let's all go well .
What I have to say is poor Lydia .
An express arrived at noon last night , as we were all in bed by Colonel Forster , to inform us that she had gone to Scotland with one of her officers; to possess the truth , with Wickham !
Imagine our surprise .
For Kitty , however , it does not seem so unexpected .
I am really , really sorry .
So imprudent a match on both sides !
But I am willing to hope for the best , and that its character has been misunderstood .
Merciless and indiscreet , I can easily believe it , but it does not (and let us rejoice) score anything bad .
His choice is at least disinterested because he must know that my father can not give him anything .
Our poor mother is sadly sorry .
My father is better .
As I am grateful that we never let them know what was said against him; we must forget it ourselves .
They had left Saturday night around noon , as it is supposed , but they were not missed until yesterday morning at eight o'clock .
The express was sent directly .
My dear Lizzy , they had to go within ten miles of us .
Colonel Forster gives us reasons to expect him here soon .
Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing him of their intention .
I must conclude because I can not be long with my poor mother .
I'm afraid you will not be able to cope , but I hardly know what I wrote .
Without giving herself the time to reflect , and hardly knowing what she was feeling , Elizabeth , in completing this letter , immediately seized the other , and , opening it with the greatest impatience , read as follows: it had been written a day after the first .
" At that moment , my dear sister , you have received my letter in a hurry , I wish that it is more intelligible , but although not limited in time , my head is so disoriented that I can not answer to be coherent .
Dear Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and that can not be delayed .
However imprudent the marriage of Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydie , we now want to make sure that it took place , for there is too much reason to fear that they will go to Scotland .
Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express .
Although Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F . made them understand that they were going to Gretna Green , Denny dropped something , expressing her belief that W . had never intended to go there or to marry Lydia , which was repeated to the colonel . F . , who , taking alarm instantly , left B . with the intention of tracing their course .
He traced them easily to Clapham , but no further; for on entering this place they retired into a carriage , and sent back the chair which had brought them from Epsom .
All we know after that is that they have been seen to continue the London route .
I do not know what to think .
After doing all the research possible on this side of London , Colonel F . entered Hertfordshire , renewing them anxiously to all the toll roads and inns of Barnet and Hatfield , but without success - we had not seen passing such people .
With the greatest interest , he went to Longbourn , and divided his apprehensions in a manner most favorable to him .
I am sincerely sorry for him and Mrs F . , but no one can blame them .
Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great .
My father and mother believe in the worst , but I can not think so bad of him .
Many circumstances might make it more permissible for them to be married privately in the city than to pursue their first plan; and even if she could form such a conception against a young woman of Lydie's relations , which is not likely , can I suppose her to be lost for everything ?
Impossible !
I regret to find , however , that Colonel F . is not disposed to depend on their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared that W . was not a trustworthy man .
My poor mother is really sick and keeps her room .
Could she practice , it would be better; but that's not to be expected .
And as for my father , never in my life have I seen him so affected .
Poor Kitty is angry for hiding their attachment; but as it was a question of trust , we can not be surprised .
I am really happy , my dear Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these painful scenes; but now , at the end of the first shock , should I acknowledge that I am waiting for your return ?
However , I am not selfish enough to insist , if that does not suit .
Farewell !
I resume my pen to do what I have just told you that I would not do; but the circumstances are such that I can not help you all sincerely to come here as soon as possible .
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not afraid to ask for it , although I still have something to ask the old man .
My father goes to London with Colonel Forster to try to find out .
What he wants to do , I'm sure , I do not know; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue the best and surest measure , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton tomorrow evening .
In such a requirement , the advice and assistance of my uncle would be all over the world; he will immediately understand what I must feel and rely on his kindness .
" Oh !
where , where is my uncle ?
cried Elizabeth , darting from her place , finishing the letter , wanting to follow it , without losing a moment of precious time; but on reaching the door a servant opened it , and M . Darcy appeared .
His pale face and his impetuous manners made him leave , and before he could begin to speak again , she , in the idea that any idea was replaced by Lydia's situation , exclaimed:  " I beg your pardon , but I must leave you .
I must find Mr. Gardiner at this time , for business that can not be delayed; I do not have a moment to lose .  " 
" Good God !
What is going on ? " 
he cried with more feeling than politeness; then remembering ,  " I will not hold you back for a minute , but leave me , or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . " 
You are not good enough; you can not go yourself .
Elizabeth hesitated , but her knees were shaking beneath her and she felt she would not gain anything if she tried to chase them .
Recalling the maid , she charged him , though with a breathless accent that made her almost unintelligible , to instantly bring back her master and her mistress .
As she left the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and appeared so miserably ill , that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration:  " Let me call your maid .  .
Is there nothing you can take to relieve yourself ?
A glass of wine; Do I have to get one ?
You are very sick .  " No , thank you , "  she replied , struggling to get up .
" There is nothing with me .
I'm pretty good; I am only troubled by some terrible news which I have just received from Longbourn .  " 
She burst into tears , alluding to it , and for a few minutes could not utter another word .
Darcy , in a miserable suspense , could only say something indistinct about his anxiety , and observe him in a compassionate silence .
Finally , she spoke again .
" I just got a letter from Jane , with such terrible news .
This can not be hidden from anyone .
My younger sister left all her friends - she ran away; broke into the power of - of Mr. Wickham .
They left together Brighton .
You know him too well to doubt the rest .
She has no money , no links , nothing to tempt her - she's lost forever .  " 
Darcy was fixed in astonishment .
" When I consider , "  she added in an even more agitated voice ,  " that I could have prevented it !
Me , who knew what he was .
I only explained part of it - part of what I learned , to my own family !
If his character had been known , it could not have happened .
But that's it - all too late now .  " 
" I am really saddened , "  cried Darcy;  " distressed - shocked .
But is it certain - absolutely certain ?
" Oh yes !
They left Brighton together Sunday evening , and were drawn almost to London , but not beyond; they certainly did not go to Scotland .  " 
" And what has been done , what has been tried to recover it ? " 
My father went to London , and Jane wrote to ask for the immediate help of my uncle , and we leave , I hope , in half an hour .
But nothing can be done - I know very well that nothing can be done .
How should such a man be worked ?
How are they still to discover ?
I do not have any hope .
It's horrible !  " 
Darcy shook her head in a silence of acquiescence .
" When my eyes were opened to his true character - Oh !
If I had known what I had , what I had dared to do !
But I did not know - I was afraid of doing too much .
Miserable , miserable mistake !
Darcy did not answer .
He scarcely seemed to hear it , and was walking about the room in meditation , his forehead contracted , his air dark .
Elizabeth soon observed , and immediately understood .
His power was flowing . everything must flow under such a proof of family weakness , such assurance of the deepest disgrace .
She could neither marvel nor condemn , but the belief of her own conquest brought nothing consoling to her bosom , did not allow her to palliate her distress .
It was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make him understand his own desires; and she had never felt so honestly that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain .
But the self , although it would impose itself , could not absorb it .
Lydia , the humiliation , the misery she brought to all , soon swallowed up all private cares; and covering her face with her handkerchief , Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and , after a pause of a few minutes , she was recalled to her situation only by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner which , although she spoke of compassion , also spoke with restraint , said: fear that you have been longing for my absence , and I have nothing to invoke as an excuse for my stay , but a real concern , though useless .
To want everything that could be said or done on my behalf to offer consolation to such distress !
But I will not torment you with vain vows , which might seem to expressly ask you to thank you .
This unfortunate affair , I fear , will prevent my sister from having the pleasure of seeing you today at Pemberley .
" Oh yes .
Please forgive Miss Darcy .
Say urgent business immediately calls us home .
Hide the unhappy truth for as long as possible , I know it can not be long .  " 
He willingly assured him of his secret; he again expressed his sorrow for his distress , wished him a happier conclusion than there was presently reason to hope for , and leaving his compliments for his relations , with only one serious look and thus , went away  .
As he was leaving the room , Elizabeth felt how unlikely it was for them to see each other in the words of cordiality which had marked their many meetings in Derbyshire; and as she cast a retrospective glance at all their knowledge , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perversity of those sentiments which would have favored its continuation , and which would have once rejoiced at its end .
If gratitude and esteem are good bases of affection , Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty .
But if otherwise - if the gaze from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , compared to what is so often described in a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be except that she had tried the latter method somewhat in her partiality for Wickham , and that her bad success might perhaps allow her to look for the other less interesting mode of attachment .
Be that as it may , she saw him leave with regret; and in this first example of what Lydia's infamy must produce , she found other anxieties in thinking of this miserable affair .
Never , since Jane's second letter , had she hoped for Wickham's meaning to marry her .
She thought that only Jane could boast of such a wait .
Surprise was the least of his feelings on this development .
While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind , she was quite surprised - all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl that it was impossible for him to marry for money; and how Lydia could have tied it up seemed incomprehensible .
But now everything was too natural .
For such an attachment as this she could have sufficient charms; and although she had not supposed that Lydia was deliberately fleeing without the intention of getting married , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would prevent her from falling prey easy .
She had never seen , while the regiment was in Hertfordshire , that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia only wanted encouragement to attach herself to anyone .
Sometimes an officer , sometimes another , had been his favorite , as their attentions raised them in his opinion .
His affections had continually fluctuated but never without object .
The misdeed of negligence and false indulgence towards such a girl - oh !
as she felt now !
She was crazy to be at home - to hear , to see , to be there to share with Jane the worries that must now fall entirely on her , in a family so upset , an absent father , a mother unable to effort and requiring a constant presence and although almost convinced that nothing could be done for Lydia , her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance , and until he entered the room his impatience was severe .
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were alarmed , supposing by the story of the servant that their niece was suddenly taken ill; but satisfying them instantly on this head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their appeal , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy . - Although Lydia has never been favorite with them . Mrs. Gardiner could only be deeply distressed .
Not only Lydia , but all were concerned by this; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , Mr. Gardiner promised all the assistance in his power .
Elizabeth , expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one mind , all that pertained to their journey was quickly settled .
They had to leave as soon as possible .
" But what must be done for Pemberley ? " 
cried Mrs. Gardiner .
" John told us that Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us , was that right ? " 
" Yes , and I told her that we should not be able to keep our engagement .
Everything is in order .
" What is settled ? " 
repeated the other , as she ran to her room to get ready .
" And are they in such conditions as for her to disclose the real truth ?
Oh , that I knew how it was !  " 
But the vows were in vain , or at least could only amuse him in the haste and confusion of the next hour .
If Elizabeth had been idle , she would have remained certain that all work was impossible for so unhappy as she; but she had her share of affairs as well as her aunt , and among the others there were notes to write to all their friends at Lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure .
An hour , however , saw the whole thing completed; and Mr. Gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , all that remained was to leave; and Elizabeth , after all the miseries of the morning , found herself , in a shorter time than she could imagine , sitting in the carriage and on the road to Longbourn .
Chapter 47  " I thought about it again , Elizabeth , "  said his uncle , as they drove out of the city; and truly , after careful consideration , I am much more inclined than myself to judge how your eldest does on this subject .
It seems to me very unlikely that a young man will do such a thing against a girl who is neither protected nor friendly , and who remains in her colonel's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope for the best .
Could he expect that his friends would not come forward ?
Could he expect to be spotted by the regiment after such an affront to Colonel Forster ?
His temptation is not adequate to the risk !  " 
" Do you really think so ? " 
cried Elizabeth , clearing herself a moment .
" On my word , "  said Mrs. Gardiner ,  " I begin to be of the opinion of your uncle .
It is really too great a violation of decency , honor and interest , for him to be guilty .
I can not think so bad of Wickham .
Can you , Lizzy , abandon it so completely to believe it capable ?
" Perhaps not to neglect his own interest , but of all negligence , I can believe him capable .
If , indeed , it should be so !
But I do not dare to hope .
Why should not they go to Scotland if this had been the case ?
" In the first place , "  replied Mr. Gardiner ,  " there is no absolute proof that they did not go to Scotland . " 
" Oh !
but their removal from the chair in a wildcat coach is such a presumption !
And besides , there is no trace of it on the road to Barnet .
" Well , then - assuming they're in London .
They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptional purposes .
It is unlikely that money is very abundant on either side; and it might seem to them that they might be more economically , though less rapidly , married in London than in Scotland .
" But why all this secret ?
Why a fear of detection ?
Why should their marriage be private ?
Oh , no , no - it's not likely .
Her peculiar friend , you see by Jane's account , was persuaded of her intention never to marry him .
Wickham will never marry a woman without a little money .
He can not afford it .
And what pretensions Lydia - what attraction does she have beyond youth , health and good humor that could make her , for her , give up all chances of getting married ?
As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the body might throw upon a dishonorable rapture with her , I can not judge; because I do not know anything about the effects that such an approach could produce .
But as for your other objection , I fear that this is hardly valid .
Lydia has no brothers to move forward; and he could imagine , from my father's conduct , his indolence , and the little attention he ever seemed to give to what was going on in his family , that he would do so little , and think little of himself , as any father could do , in such a case .  " 
" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to anything but the love of him that to consent to live with him on terms other than marriage ? " 
" It looks good , and it's really shocking , "  replied Elizabeth , with tears in her eyes ,  " that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit doubt .
But , really , I do not know what to say .
Maybe I do not do him justice .
But she is very young . we have never learned to think of serious subjects; and for the last half-year , no , for a twelvemonth - she was given nothing but fun and vanity .
She was allowed to dispose of her time in the most insane and frivolous manner , and to adopt the opinions that came to her .
Since the County was established at Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation and officers have been in his head .
She did everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give more - how should I call her ?
susceptibility to his feelings; who are naturally quite animated .
And we all know that Wickham has all the charms of the person and the address that can captivate a woman .  " 
" But you see Jane , "  said her aunt ,  " do not think so bad of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt .
Who does Jane think she's sick of ?
And who is there , whatever their previous conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , until it was proved against them ?
But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is .
We both know that he was debauched in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honor; that he is as false and misleading as he insinuates .
" And you really know all that ? " 
cried Mrs. Gardiner , whose curiosity about the mode of her intelligence was alive .
" Indeed , "  Elizabeth replied , coloring .
" I told you the other day about his infamous behavior to Mr. Darcy , and you yourself , when you were at Longbourn , heard how he was talking about the man who had behaved with so much indulgence and liberality towards him .
And there are other circumstances that I am not at liberty - that it is not worth telling; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless .
From what he said about Miss Darcy , I was quite ready to see a proud , reserved and unpleasant girl .
Yet he knew the opposite himself .
He must know that she was as kind and unpretentious as we found her .
But Lydia does not know ?
can she ignore what you and Jane seem to understand so well ?
" Oh , yes - it's the worst of all .
Until I was in Kent , and I saw both Mr. Darcy and his relationship with Colonel Fitzwilliam , I myself was ignorant of the truth .
And when I got home , the county had to leave Meryton in a week or a fortnight .
As was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole thing , nor me , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for what use is it to anyone , that the good opinion that the whole neighborhood had of him would be overthrown ?
And even when it was decided that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the need to open my eyes to her character never came to my mind .
This she could be in danger of the deception ever entered my head .
That such a consequence could ensue , you can easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts .  " 
" So when they all left for Brighton , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe they loved each other ?
" Not the least .
I do not remember any symptoms of affection on either side; and if something like that had been noticeable , you must know that our family is not a family on which it could be thrown .
When he entered the body for the first time , she was ready to admire him; but we were all .
Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about her for the first two months; but he never distinguished him by any particular attention; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and savage admiration , his fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated him with more distinction , became his favorites again .  " 
    One can easily believe that , even if little novelty could be added to their fears , hopes and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could hold them for long , all the time . travel .
According to Elizabeth's thoughts , she was never away .
Fixed there by the most acute anguish , self-reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness .
They traveled as quickly as possible and , sleeping for a night on the road , reached Longbourn at dinner time the next day .
Elizabeth considered that Jane could not be tired by long waits .
The little guardians , attracted by the sight of a chaise-longue , stood on the steps of the house as they entered the enclosure; and when the carriage arrived at the door , the joyous surprise which lit their faces and which spread over their whole body , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasure of their welcome .
Elizabeth jumped; and , after giving each of them a hurried kiss , rushed into the vestibule , where Jane , who was coming down from her mother's apartment , immediately met her .
Elizabeth , as she embraced him affectionately , while tears filled the eyes of the two , did not lose a moment in asking if they had heard of the fugitives .
" Not yet , "  Jane replied .
" But now that my dear uncle has come , I hope everything will be fine . " 
" Is my father in town ? " 
" Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . " 
" And have you heard of him often ? " 
" We only heard twice .
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to tell me that he had arrived safely and to give me his instructions , which I particularly begged him to do .
He simply added that he should not write until he has something important to mention .  " 
" And my mother - how is she ?
How are you all ? " 
My mother is doing pretty well , I hope , but her spirits are very shaken .
She climbs the stairs and will have a great satisfaction to see you all .
She's not coming out of her bathroom yet .
Mary and Kitty , thank goodness , are doing very well .  " 
" But you - how are you ? " 
exclaimed Elizabeth .
" You are pale .
How much you had to cross !  " 
Her sister , however , assured her that she was perfectly fine; and their conversation , which had passed while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children , was now ended by the approach of the whole party .
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and greeted them and thanked them both , with alternating smiles and tears .
When they were all in the living room , the questions Elizabeth had asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon realized that Jane had no intelligence to give .
However , the sanguinary hope of goodness , suggested by the benevolence of her heart , had not yet abandoned her; she was still expecting everything to end well , and that every morning would bring a letter , either from Lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and , perhaps , announce their marriage .
Mrs. Bennet , at the apartment from which they all repaired , after a few minutes of conversation together , received them exactly as one might expect; with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham , and complaints of his own sufferings and misuse; blame everyone except the person for the unhealthy indulgence of which the debts of his daughter must primarily be due .
" If I could , "  she said ,  " go to Brighton with all my family , it would not have happened , but poor Lydia had no one to look after her .
Why did the Forsters ever let it go ?
I'm sure there was a great deal of neglect or other on their side , because she's not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well cared for .
I always thought they were very unfit to take charge of her; but I was rejected , as I always am .
Poor dear child !
And now , here is Mr. Bennet gone , and I know he will fight against Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what will become of us all ?
The Collins will kick us out before he gets cold in his grave , and if you're not nice to us , brother , I do not know what we'll do .
They all exclaimed against such terrible ideas; and Mr. Gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for herself and all her family , told him that he intended to be in London the next day , and would assist Mr. Bennet in all efforts to recover Lydia  .
" Do not give in to an unnecessary alarm , "  he added;  " Although it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no need to consider it certain .
It's not quite a week since they left Brighton .
In a few days we will be able to hear new ones; and until we know that they are not married and that they have no intention of getting married , do not let the affair be lost .
As soon as I get to town , I'll go to my brother's house and take him home to Gracechurch Street; and then we can consult together on what needs to be done .  " 
" Oh !
my dear brother ,  " replied Mrs. Bennet , "  that's exactly what I want most .
And now , when you come to town , find them wherever they are; and if they are not already married , get them married .
And for wedding clothes , do not let them wait , but tell Lydia that she will have as much money as she wants to buy them after their wedding .
And most importantly , prevent Mr. Bennet from fighting .
Tell him what an awful state I am , how frightened I am , and how much I have such tremors and flutterings on me - spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such heartbeats , that I can not rest at night or during the day .
And tell my dear Lydia not to give any indication of her clothes until she saw me , because she does not know which are the best warehouses .
Oh my brother , how nice you are !
I know you will do everything .
But M . Gardiner , though he assured him still of his serious efforts in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to him , as much in his hopes as in his fear; and after talking with her in this way until dinner was on the table , they all left her to express all her feelings about the maid , who attended in the absence of her daughters .
Although her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real opportunity for family seclusion , they did not try to oppose it because they knew it was not He was not careful enough to hold his tongue in front of the servants while they waited . He thought it best that only one member of the family , and the one to whom they could best trust , understood all his fears and his concern about it .
In the dining room , they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty , who had been too busy in their separate apartments to make their appearance before .
One came from his books and the other from his toilet .
The faces of the two , however , were quite calm; and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favorite sister , or the anger she herself had incurred in this affair , had given her people more trouble than usual . Kitty accents .
As for Marie , she was sufficiently mistress of herself to murmur to Elizabeth , with a look of grave reflection , a short time after they were seated at the table:  " It is a very unfortunate affair , and one will probably talk a lot about it .
But we must stop the tide of wickedness and pour into the bruised breasts both the balm of fraternal consolation .
Then , perceiving in Elizabeth no desire to answer , she added:  " Unfortunate that the event must be for Lydie , we can draw this useful lesson: the loss of virtue in a woman is irremediable , this misstep the leads endlessly . ruin , that her reputation is no less fragile than beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behavior toward the unworthy of the other sex .  " 
Elizabeth looked up in astonishment , but she was too oppressed to answer .
Mary , however , continued to console herself with this kind of moral extraction of evil before them .
In the afternoon , the two eldest girls , Miss Bennet , could be alone for half an hour; and Elizabeth immediately took advantage of the opportunity to do research , which Jane was also eager to satisfy .
After joining in the general lamentations of the terrible consequence of this event , which Elizabeth considered almost certain , and which Miss Bennett could not pretend to be entirely impossible , the first continued the subject , saying ,  " But tell me everything and everything . I have not heard yet .
Give me other details .
What did Colonel Forster say ?
Did they have no apprehension of anything before the kidnapping ?
They must have seen them together forever .  " 
Colonel Forster admitted that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia's side , but nothing to alarm him .
I am so sorry for him !
His behavior was attentive and kind to the maximum .
He came to us , to make sure of his anxiety , before he had the idea of ​​not having gone to Scotland: when this apprehension came out for the first time , she hastened her journey .
" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ?
Did he know they were going to leave ?
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ?
" Yes , but , questioned by him , Denny denied knowing everything about their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it .
He did not repeat his persuasion of not getting married - and from what I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before .
" And until Colonel Forster came himself , none of you doubted , I suppose , to be really married ?
" How was it possible for such an idea to enter our brain ?
I felt a little uncomfortable , a little worried about my sister's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his behavior was not always right .
My father and my mother did not know anything; they only felt like a reckless match that must be .
Kitty then possessed , with a very natural triumph , to know more than all of us , that in the last letter of Lydia she had prepared her at such a pace .
She had known , it seems , that they were in love with each other , several weeks .
" But not before they went to Brighton ? " 
" No , I do not think so . " 
And did Colonel Forster seem to think of Wickham himself ?
Does he know his real character ?
I must admit that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he was .
He thought him imprudent and extravagant .
And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he has left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope it can be wrong .  " 
" Oh , Jane , if we had been less secret , if we had said what we knew about him , it could not have happened ! " 
" Maybe it would have been better , "  his sister replied .
" But to expose the old faults of a person without knowing what his present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable .
We acted with the best intentions .  " 
" Could Colonel Forster repeat the details of Lydia's note to his wife ? " 
" He brought it with us to see us . " 
Jane then took it from her paperback , and gave it to Elizabeth .
It was the contents:  " MY DEAR HARRIET "  , You'll laugh when you know where I went , and I can not help but laugh at your surprise tomorrow morning , as soon as I miss .
I'm going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess who , I'll consider you a fool , because there's only one man in the world I love , and he's an angel .
I should never be happy without him , so do not think it's dangerous to leave .
You do not need to tell them at Longbourn of my departure , if you do not like it , because that will surprise the most , when I write to them and that I will sign my name , Lydia Wickham .
What a good joke it will be !
I can hardly write to laugh .
Take my apologies to Pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight .
Tell him that I hope he will excuse me when he knows everything; and tell him that I will dance with him at the next ball we will meet with great pleasure .
I will send my clothes when I arrive at Longbourn; but I would like you to tell Sally to fix a big slit in my muslin dress before they're packed .
Goodbye .
Give my love to Colonel Forster .
I hope you will drink on our good trip .
" Your loving friend , "  LYDIA BENNET .  " 
" Oh !
Lydia thoughtless and thoughtless !
exclaimed Elizabeth when she had finished .
" What letter is this , to write in such a moment !
But at least that shows that she was serious about their trip .
Whatever he could then persuade her , it was not a schema of infamy .
My poor father !
as he must have felt !
" I have never seen anyone so shocked .
He could not speak a word for ten minutes .
My mother was sick immediately , and the whole house in such confusion !
" Oh !
Jane , exclaimed Elizabeth , was there a servant who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ?
" I do not know .
I hope there was .
But being kept in such a moment is very difficult .
My mother was in hysteria and , although I tried to give her all possible help , I'm afraid I did not do as much as I would have done !
But the horror of what could happen had almost taken away my faculties .
Your presence to her has been too much for you .
You do not look well .
Oh , that I had been with you !
you have had every care and concern about yourself alone .  " 
" Mary and Kitty were very kind and would have shared all their hardships , I'm sure , but I did not think it was good for one or the other .
Kitty is light and delicate; and Mary studies so much that her hours of rest must not be broken .
Aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father's departure; and was so good to stay until Thursday with me .
It was a great use and comfort for all of us .
And Lady Lucas was very kind; she wandered here Wednesday morning to visit us and offered us her services , or one of her daughters , if they were useful to us .
" She should have stayed home , "  cried Elizabeth; she may have liked it , but under such a misfortune , one does not see too few of her neighbors .
Assistance is impossible . unbearable condolence .
Let them triumph over us from a distance , and be satisfied .  " 
She began to learn about the steps her father was planning to take in town for her daughter's recovery .
" He meant that I believe , "  Jane replied ,  " go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try to find out if anything could be done about them .
His main purpose must be to discover the number of the coachman who took them from Clapham .
He had come with a London prize; and as he thought that one man and one lady could be noticed passing from one car to another , he wanted to inquire at Clapham .
If he could somehow find out in which house the coachman had already deposited his ticket , he resolved to search there and hoped that it would not be impossible to find the position and number of the coach .
I do not know any other drawing he has formed; but he was so anxious to be gone , and his minds so deeply disconcerted , that I found it difficult to discover him .
Chapter 48 The whole party was hoping for a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing him a single line .
His family knew that he was , on all common occasions , a very careless and dilatory correspondent; but at that moment they had hoped for the effort .
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasant intelligence to send; but even that , they would have been happy to be certain .
Mr. Gardiner had only waited for the letters before leaving .
When he was gone , they were at least sure of constantly receiving news of what was going on , and their uncle promised , by separating himself , to bring Mr. Bennet back to Longbourn , as soon as possible , to great consolation . her sister , who considered her the only guarantee that her husband would not be killed in a duel .
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to stay a few days longer in Hertfordshire , for the first thought her presence might be useful to her nieces .
She shared their presence on Mrs. Bennet , and was a great comfort to them in their spare time .
Their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , in order to encourage and encourage them - but as she never came without reporting a new example of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity . she rarely left without leaving them . more discouraged than she found him .
All Meryton seemed to be trying to blacken the man who , three months earlier , had almost been an angel of light .
He was declared in debt to all the merchants of the place , and his intrigues , all honored with the title of seduction , had been extended to the family of each merchant .
Everyone has declared that he is the most wicked young man in the world; and everyone was beginning to realize that they had always been suspicious of the appearance of his goodness .
Elizabeth , though she did not believe more than half of what was said , believed enough that her first assurance of the ruin of her sister was more certain; and even Jane , who believed even less , was almost desperate , especially since the time had come when , if they had gone to Scotland , which she had never despaired , they had probably won news  . two .
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; On Tuesday , his wife received a letter from him; he told them that when he arrived he immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham before his arrival , but without obtaining satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to find out about all the major hotels in the city , since Mr. Bennet thought it was possible for them to go to one of them when they first came to London before to get housing .
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was impatient , he wanted to help him to continue .
He added that Mr. Bennet seemed quite reluctant to leave London and promised to write very soon .
There was also a postscript to that effect:  " I wrote to Colonel Forster asking him to know , if possible , from some of the close friends of the regiment , whether Wickham had any relations or relations likely to know it . in what part of the city he hid .
If there were anyone who could be approached with a probability of obtaining such an index , this could have an essential consequence .
Currently , we have nothing to guide us .
Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this subject .
But , after reflection , perhaps , Lizzy could tell us what relationships he's living now , better than anyone else .  " 
Elizabeth did not fail to understand whence came this deference for her authority; but it was not in his power to give such satisfactory information as the compliment deserved .
She had never heard of her relationship , except for a father and mother , both of whom had been dead for many years .
It was possible , however , that some of his companions in the county might be able to give more information; and although she was not very optimistic about waiting for it , the app was something to be hoped for .
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was planned .
The arrival of letters was the great object of impatience every morning .
Through the letters , everything that was good or bad had to be communicated , and each day had to bring news of importance .
But before they heard Mr. Gardiner again , a letter arrived for their father , of a different quarter , from Mr. Collins; which , as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she read accordingly; and Elizabeth , who knew what curiosities her letters were always , looked at her and read her alike .
It was as follows:  " MY DEAR SIR "  , I feel called , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to comfort you with the painful affliction you are suffering now , of which we were informed yesterday by a letter from Hertfordshire .
Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and I sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be the most bitter , because proceeding from a cause that time can not remove .
No argument will fail on my part to appease such a grave misfortune , or to comfort you , in a circumstance which must be the most distressing for all the parents .
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison to that .
And it is all the more to be deplored , that there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte told me , that this license of conduct to your daughter came from a bad degree of indulgence; but , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such enormity , at such a young age  .
Be that as it may , you are cruelly to be pitied; In this opinion , I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair .
They agree with me to understand that this misstep in one girl will hurt the fortune of all the others; for who , as Lady Catherine condescends to say , will connect to such a family ?
And this consideration leads me , moreover , to reflect , with greater satisfaction , on a certain event of last November; for if it had been otherwise , I must have been mixed up in all your troubles and disgraces .
Let me then advise you , my dear sir , to console you as much as possible , to rid yourself of your affection unworthy of your affection forever , and to let it reap the fruits of its own odious offense .
" I am , my dear sir , etc . , etc . " 
Mr. Gardiner no longer writes until he receives a reply from Colonel Forster; and then there was nothing pleasing to send .
We did not know that Wickham had a unique relationship with which he had connections , and he was sure he did not have a close existence .
His old acquaintances had been numerous; but since he was in the militia , he did not seem to have any particular friendship with any of them .
There was therefore no one who could be reported as likely to give news of him .
And in the misery of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of Lydia's relationship finding , as he had just been sweating that he had left behind very gambling debts considerable .
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be required to pay for his expenses at Brighton .
He owed a lot to the city , but his debts of honor were even more formidable .
Mr. Gardiner did not try to hide these details from the Longbourn family .
Jane heard them in horror .
" A player ! " 
She cried .
" It's completely unexpected .
I had no idea .  " 
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter that they could expect to see their father at home the next day , which was Saturday .
He was rendered without mind by the bad success of all their efforts; he had yielded to his brother-in-law's supplicant to return to his family and to allow him to make all the opportunities that would be convenient for him to continue his pursuit .
When Ms . Bennet was informed of this , she did not express as much satisfaction as her children were waiting for her , considering what her anxiety was for her life before .
" What , he comes home , and without poor Lydia ? " 
She cried .
" Of course , he will not leave London until he finds them .
Who should fight Wickham and force him to marry him , if he goes ?
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was decided that she and the children would go to London , at the same time that Mr. Bennet would leave .
The coach took the first step of their journey and brought his master back to Longbourn .
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity of Elizabeth and her friend from Derbyshire who had followed her to this part of the world .
His name had never been mentioned voluntarily before them by his niece; and the kind of half-expectancy Mrs. Gardiner had formed , followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing .
Elizabeth had not received any since her return , which could come from Pemberley .
The unhappy state of the family rendered all other excuses for the baseness of his mind useless; Nothing could be conjectured enough , though Elizabeth , who already knew her own feelings , was well aware that had she not known of Darcy , she could have borne more the horror of Lydia's infamy .  .  .
That would have spared him , she thought , one night of insomnia out of two .
When Mr. Bennet arrived , he had the appearance of his usual philosophical coolness .
He said as little as he had ever used to say; he did not speak of the affairs which had prevailed , and it took some time before his daughters had the courage to speak of it .
It was not until the afternoon , when he had joined them to tea , that Elizabeth dared to present the subject; then , after briefly expressing his sorrow for what he had to endure , he replied:  " Do not say anything about it .
Who should suffer but myself ?
That's what I did , and I should feel it .
" You must not be too harsh on yourself , "  replied Elizabeth .
" You can warn me against such an evil .
Human nature is so prone to falling in !
No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I've been to blame .
I'm not afraid of being controlled by the impression .
He will soon disappear .  " 
Do you believe they are in London ?
" Yes , where else can they be so well hidden ? " 
" And Lydia used to want to go to London , "  Kitty added .
" She is happy then , "  said her father curtly;  " and his residence there will probably be of a certain duration . " 
Then , after a short silence , he continued:  " Lizzy , I take no ill will to have been justified in your advice last May , which , given the event , shows a certain grandeur of spirit . " 
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet , who came to fetch her mother's tea .
" It is a parade , "  he exclaimed ,  " who does a good thing; he gives such elegance to misfortune !
Another day I will do the same; I am going to sit in my library , in my nightcap and my powdered dress , and give as much trouble as I can; or , maybe , I can delay until Kitty runs away .  " 
" I'm not going to run away , dad , "  Kitty said frantically .
" If I ever went to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . " 
" You will go to Brighton .
I would not trust you so close to Eastbourne for fifty pounds !
No , Kitty , I finally learned to be careful , and you will feel the effects .
No officer should ever return to my house or even cross the village .
Balls will be absolutely forbidden unless you get up with one of your sisters .
And you'll never go out of doors before you can prove that you've spent ten minutes every day in a rational way .
Kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , started crying .
" Well , "  he said ,  " do not make yourself unhappy .
If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them .  " 
Chapter 49 Two days after Mr. Bennet's return , as Jane and Elizabeth walked together in the shrubs behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and , concluding that she was coming to call their mother , went out to meet her .  . ; but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to Miss Bennet:  " I beg your pardon , madame , for interrupting you , but I hoped that you would have good news of the city , then I took the liberty to come and ask .
" What do you mean , Hill ?
We did not hear anything from the city .  " 
" Dear Madam , "  cried Mrs. Hill in astonishment ,  " do you not know that there is an express of Master Gardiner ?
He has been here this half hour and the master has received a letter .
Away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time to talk .
They crossed the vestibule in the breakfast room; from there to the library; their father was neither of them; and they were on the point of looking for him on the stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said to them:  " If you seek my master , madame , he walks towards the little grove .
On this information , they immediately crossed the room once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way to a small wood on one side of the paddock .
Jane , who was not so light and was not so used to running as Elizabeth , soon let herself go , while her sister , out of breath , came with him and shouted eagerly ,  " Oh , daddy .  , what news ? new ?
Have you heard of my uncle ?
" Yes I received a letter from him on purpose . " 
" Well , what news does this bring - good or bad ? " 
" What is good to expect ? " 
he said , taking the letter from his pocket .
" But maybe you would like to read it . " 
Elizabeth caught him impatiently with his hand .
Jane has come now .
" Read it aloud , "  said their father ,  " because I do not know what it is .
" Gracechurch Street , Monday , August 2nd .
" My dear brother , "  I can finally send you some news of my niece , and , on the whole , I hope that will give you satisfaction .
Not long after you left me on Saturday , I was lucky to know what part of London they were .
The details that I reserve until we meet; it is enough to know that they are discovered .
I saw them both  . . .  "  "  So , as I had always hoped ,  " cried Jane , "  they are married !
Elizabeth read ,  " I saw them both .
They are not married , and I can not find any intention to be; but if you want to fulfill the commitments I dared to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are .
All that is required of you is to ensure to your daughter , by regulation , her equal share of the five thousand pounds which you acquired in your children after the death of you and my sister; and besides , undertake to allow him , during your life , a hundred pounds a year .
These are conditions that , considering everything , I did not hesitate to respect , as far as I thought I was privileged , for you .
I will send it by express so that you do not waste time bringing me your answer .
You will easily understand from these details that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not as hopeless as is generally believed .
The world has been deceived in this respect; and I am happy to say that there will be a little money , even when all his debts will be paid , to settle on my niece , in addition to his own fortune .
If , as I conclude , it will be , you give me full powers to act on your behalf throughout this whole affair , I will immediately instruct Haggerston to prepare an appropriate settlement .
There will be no occasion for your return to the city; So stay quiet in Longbourn and depend on my diligence and care .
Send back your answer as soon as possible , and be careful to write explicitly .
We thought it best that my niece be married to this house , and I hope you will approve it .
She comes to us today .
I will write again as soon as something more is determined .
Yours , etc . ,  " EDW .
GARDINER .  " 
" It's possible ? " 
exclaimed Elizabeth when she had finished .
" Can it be possible that he marries her ? " 
" Wickham is not so bad , so , as we thought , "  said his sister .
" My dear father , I congratulate you . " 
" And did you answer the letter ? " 
exclaimed Elizabeth .
" No , but it must be done soon . " 
Most sincerely she then begged him not to waste time before writing .
" Oh !
my dear father ,  " she cried , "  come back and write right away .
Consider the importance of each moment in such a case .  " 
" Let me write for you , "  Jane said ,  " if you do not like the problem yourself . " 
" I do not like him very much , "  he replied;  " but it must be done . " 
And saying this , he turned with them and went to the house .
" And may I ask  . . . "  said Elisabeth;  " But the terms , I suppose , must be respected . " 
" Conform to !
I'm only ashamed to ask him so little .
" And they must get married !
Yet he is such a man !
" Yes , yes , they have to get married .
There is nothing else to do .
But there are two things I really want to know; One is , how much money your uncle put to realize it; and the other , how could I pay for it ?
" Money !
My uncle ! " 
exclaimed Jane , what do you mean , sir ?
" I mean , that no man in his senses would marry Lydia with so slight a temptation as a hundred a year for my life , and fifty after I left . " 
" That's very true , "  said Elizabeth;  " Even if it had not happened to me before .
His debts to be discharged , and something to stay !
Oh !
it must be the actions of my uncle !
Generous , good man , I'm afraid he's grieved .
A small sum could not do all this .  " 
" No , "  said his father; Wickham is a fool if he takes it with a farthing of less than ten thousand pounds .
I would be sorry to think so badly of him , at the very beginning of our relationship .  " 
" Ten thousand pounds !
God forbid !
How can a half-sum be refunded ?
Mr. Bennet did not answer , and each of them , deep in thought , remained silent until they reached the house .
Their father then wrote to the library , and the girls entered the breakfast room .
" And they really have to get married ! " 
cried Elizabeth , as soon as they were alone .
" It's strange !
And for that , we must be grateful .
That they marry , small as their chance of happiness , and miserable as his character , we are forced to rejoice .
Oh , Lydia !
" I console myself thinking , "  answered Jane ,  " that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he did not have a real regard for her .
Although our kindly uncle did something to clear him up , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like that , has been brought forward .
He has children and can have more .
How could he save half a thousand pounds ?
" If he was able to learn what Wickham's debts were , "  said Elizabeth ,  " and how much is arranged on her sister , we will know exactly what Mr. Gardiner did for them , because Wickham does not have six pence of his own .
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be rewarded .
Bringing them back home and offering them personal protection and a face is such a sacrifice to their advantage , because the years of gratitude are not enough to recognize it .
At this moment she is actually with them !
If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy !
What a meeting for her , when she sees my aunt for the first time !
" We must strive to forget everything that has happened on both sides , "  said Jane:  " I hope and trust that they will be happy again .
His consent to marry him is proof , I believe , that he has arrived at a good way of thinking .
Their mutual affection will stabilize them; and I flatter myself that they will settle so quietly , and live so rationally , that they will perhaps forget their past imprudence .
" Their conduct was such , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " as neither you , nor me , nor anyone can ever forget .
It is useless to talk about it .  " 
The girls then realized that their mother did not know what had happened .
So they went to the library and asked their father if he did not want them to let him know .
He wrote and , without raising his head , replied coldly:  " As you wish .
" Can we take my uncle's letter to read to him ? " 
" Take what you want , and leave . " 
Elizabeth took the letter from her writing table , and they went up the stairs together .
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet , so a communication would do for everyone .
After a little preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud .
Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself .
As soon as Jane had read Lydia's hope of seeing Lydia soon get married , her joy burst forth , and each subsequent sentence added to her exuberance .
She was now in such violent irritation of pleasure , as she had always been agitated by alarm and vexation .
To know that her daughter would be married was enough .
She was not troubled by any fear for her happiness , nor humiliated by the memory of her misconduct .
" My dear , dear Lydia ! " 
She cried .
" It's delicious indeed !
She will be married !
I will see it again !
She will be married at sixteen !
My good , kind brother !
I knew how it would be .
I knew he was going to handle everything !
How I want to see her !
and see also dear Wickham !
But the clothes , the wedding clothes !
I will write directly to my sister Gardiner .
Lizzy , my dear , come down to your father and ask him how much he is going to give him .
Stay , stay , I'll go myself .
Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill .
I'll put my things in a moment .
My dear , dear Lydia !
How happy we will be together when we meet !
Her eldest daughter tried to give some respite to the violence of these transports , leading her thoughts to the obligations that the behavior of Mr. Gardiner imposed upon them .
" For it is necessary to attribute this happy conclusion , "  she added ,  " to a great extent to his goodness .
We are confident that he is committed to helping Mr. Wickham with money .  " 
" Well , "  cried his mother ,  " all this is right , who should do it , besides his own uncle ?
If he had not had his own family , I and my children should have had all his money , you know; and this is the first time we have anything of him , except some gifts .
Good !
I am very happy !
In a short time , I will have a married girl .
Mme Wickham !
Like that sounds good !
And she was only sixteen last June .
My dear Jane , I am in such a state of flight that I am sure I can not write; so I'm going to dictate , and you write for me .
We will settle with your father the money later; but things should be ordered immediately .  " 
She then proceeded to all the details of calico , muslin and batiste , and soon she would have dictated many orders , if Jane , although with some difficulty , had persuaded her to wait until her father was at home . leisure to be consulted .
A day late , she remarked , would be of little importance; and his mother was too happy to be as obstinate as usual .
Other projects have also appeared in his head .
" I'm going to Meryton , "  she said ,  " as soon as I get dressed , and tell the good news to my sister Philips .
And as I come back , I can call Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long .
Kitty , get out and order the car .
A broadcast would do me a lot of good , I'm sure .
Girls , can I do something for you in Meryton ?
Oh !
Here is Hill !
My dear Hill , did you hear the good news ?
Miss Lydia is getting married; and you'll all have a bowl of punch to make at her wedding .
Mrs. Hill immediately began to express her joy .
Elizabeth received her congratulations from the others , then , sick of this madness , took refuge in her own room , to be able to think with freedom .
The situation of poor Lydia must , at best , be bad enough; but it was not worse , she needed to be grateful .
She felt it so; and if , in the future , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be expected for her sister , thinking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had won .
Mr. Bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending all his income , he would have paid an annual sum for the best provision of his children and his wife , if it survived him .
He wanted it now more than ever .
If he had done his duty in this respect , Lydia did not need to be indebted to her uncle for anything that could be bought for her .
The satisfaction of ruling one of the poorest young men in Britain to be her husband would have been able to rest in her place .
He is seriously concerned that any cause so unfavorable to anyone should be passed on to his brother-in-law alone , and he is determined , if possible , to know the extent of his assistance and to fulfill the obligation as soon as he could .
When Mr. Bennet married for the first time , the economy was deemed perfectly useless because , of course , they had to have a son .
The son was to join him as soon as he was of age , and the widow and the younger children would be thus provided .
Five girls entered the world successively , but the son was coming; and Mrs. Bennet , for many years after Lydia's birth , had been certain that he would do it .
This event was finally desperate , but it was too late to save .
Mrs. Bennet had no turn for the economy , and her husband's love of independence alone had prevented them from exceeding their incomes .
Five thousand pounds were settled by marriage items on Mrs. Bennet and the children .
But in what proportions it was to be shared among them depended on the will of the parents .
It was a point , at least in regard to Lydie , which had to be settled , and Mr. Bennet could not hesitate to accede to the proposal before him .
In terms of grateful thanks for the kindness of his brother , although expressed in the most concise manner , he then gave on paper his perfect approval of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfill the commitments that had been made made for him .
He had never before supposed that Wickham could prevail over his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience for himself as by the present arrangement .
It would be scarcely ten pounds a year for the loser of the hundred to be paid to them; for with her pension and pocket allowance , and the continual gifts of money which had been given her by her mother's hands , Lydia's expenses had been very small in this sum .
That it was done with such small efforts on his side too , was another welcome surprise; because his current desire was to have as few problems as possible in the trade .
When the first transports of rage which had produced its activity by seeking it were terminated , it naturally returned to all its former indolence .
His letter was soon dispatched; for although he was dilatory in his affairs , he was quick to execute it .
He begged to know the details of what he owed his brother , but he was too angry with Lydia to send him a message .
The good news spreads quickly across the house , and with adequate speed across the neighborhood .
It has been worn in the latter with a decent philosophy .
Admittedly , it would have been more for the benefit of the conversation that Miss Lydia Bennet would have come on the town; or , as the happiest alternative , has been isolated from the world , in a distant farm .
But there was much to say in marrying him; and the beloved vows for her welfare which had preceded all the old wicked ladies in Meryton have lost some of their wit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband his misery was considered certain .
Mrs. Bennet had been down for a fortnight; but on that happy day she sat down again at the head of her table , and in an oppressive mood .
No sense of shame ended his triumph .
The marriage of a girl , who had been the first object of her vows since the age of sixteen , was about to be finished , and her thoughts and her words turned entirely on the assistants of elegant nuptials , beautiful muslins , new cars , and servants .
She was actively looking for a suitable situation in the neighborhood for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , she rejected many as being of insufficient size and importance .
" Haye Park could do it , "  she said ,  " if the Goulding could leave it , or the big house in Stoke , if the salon was bigger , but Ashworth is too far away !
I could not bear to have it ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge , the granaries are awful .  " 
Her husband allowed her to speak without interruption while the servants remained .
But when they retired , he said to her ,  " Mrs. Bennet , before taking one or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us get a good understanding .
In a house of this neighborhood , they will never be admitted .
I will not encourage the impudence of one or the other , by receiving them at Longbourn .
A long dispute followed this statement; but Mr. Bennet was firm .
He soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found , with astonishment and horror , that her husband would not advance a Guinea to buy clothes for her daughter .
He protested that she would not receive from him any sign of affection whatsoever on this occasion .
Mrs. Bennet could hardly understand .
That her anger could be carried to such an inconceivable point of resentment as to deny her daughter a privilege without which her marriage would not seem worthwhile , surpassed all she could possibly believe .
She was more alive to the disgrace that her lack of new clothes was to reflect on her daughter's wedding , than to any sense of shame at having fled and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place .
Elizabeth deeply regretted that she had , by the distress of the moment , made known to M . Darcy their fears for his sister; for since her marriage would promptly give the proper end to the abduction , they might hope to conceal her unfavorable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot .
She did not fear to extend it further by her means .
There were few persons on whose secret she would surely have depended; but , at the same time , there was no one whose knowledge of the fragility of a sister would have mortified her - however , any fear of individual disadvantage for her , because , in any case , there seemed to be a an impassable abyss between them .
If Lydia's marriage had been concluded in the most honorable terms , it was not to be assumed that Mr. Darcy was connecting to a family where , at all other oppositions , there would be an alliance and a relationship of the closest kind . with a man he so rightly despised .
From such a connection , she could not wonder if it would shrink .
The desire to obtain her esteem , that she had made sure of her feelings in Derbyshire , could not , in the rational expectation , survive such a blow .
She was humiliated , she was pained; she repented , even if she did not know what .
She became jealous of her esteem , when she could no longer hope to enjoy it .
She wanted to hear about him , when there seemed to be any chance of gaining intelligence .
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely that they would meet .
What a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals she had proudly rejected four months ago would now have been welcomed with the greatest joy and gratitude !
He was as generous , she did not doubt , as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal , there must have been a triumph .
She began to understand that he was exactly the man who , in his dispositions and talents , would suit him best .
His understanding and character , although different from his , would have met all his desires .
It was a union which was to be to the advantage of both; by his facility and vivacity , his mind could be softened , his manners improved; and from her judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have been given greater importance .
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what bliss really was .
A union of a different tendency and excluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family .
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in a tolerable independence she could not imagine .
But how little permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were united only because their passions were stronger than their virtues , she could easily conjecture .
    Mr. Gardiner soon wrote to his brother .
At the recognition of Mr. Bennet , he replied briefly , with the assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of his whole family; and concluded with instances that the subject might never be mentioned again to him .
The main purpose of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had decided to leave the militia .
" I really wanted him to do it , "  he added , as soon as his marriage was fixed .
And I think you will agree with me , considering the dismissal of this body as highly desirable , both for himself and my niece .
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go to the regulars; and among his old friends , there are still some who are capable and eager to assist him in the army .
He has the promise of a sign in the regiment of General ---- , now confined to the North .
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom .
He promises fairly; and I hope that among the different people , where they can each have a character to preserve , they will both be more cautious .
I wrote to Colonel Forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in Brighton and the surrounding area , with the assurance of a prompt payment , which I I promised .
And will you give the trouble to give similar assurances to his Meryton creditors , of which I will list according to his information ?
He gave in all his debts; I hope he has not deceived us at least .
Haggerston has our instructions , and everything will be finished in a week .
They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner , that my niece is very anxious to see you all before she leaves the south .
She is well , and asks to be conscientiously reminded of you and her mother  .-- Yours , etc . ,  " E .
GARDINER .  " 
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the benefits of Wickham's expulsion from the county of ---- as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do .
But Mrs. Bennet was not very satisfied with it .
Lydia having settled in the North , at the moment when she had expected more pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means renounced her plan of residence in Hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment; and , besides , it was so unfortunate that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she knew everyone , and had so many favorites .
" She likes Mrs. Forster so much , "  she said ,  " it will be pretty shocking to send her away !
And there are also several young men she likes a lot .
The officers may not be so agreeable in the general's regiment .
The request of his daughter , to be considered , to be reintegrated into her family before leaving for the North , received at first an absolute negative .
But Jane and Elizabeth , who agreed to wish their sister's feelings and consequences to be noticed by her parents at her wedding , urged her so sincerely but so rationally and moderately to receive her . and her husband at Longbourn , as soon as they got married , that he was persuaded to think as they thought , and act as they wished .
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighborhood before she was banished to the North .
When Mr. Bennet wrote to his brother , he sent him permission to come; and it was agreed that as soon as the ceremony was over they would go to Longbourn .
Elizabeth was surprised , however , that Wickham consented to such a project , and if she had consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her desires .
Chapter 51 The wedding day of their sister has arrived; Jane and Elizabeth probably felt more for her than for herself .
The car was sent to meet them at  . . . and they had to go home at dinner time .
Their arrival was dreaded by Elder Miss Bennets , and especially Jane , who gave Lydia the feelings that would have occupied if she had been the culprit , and was miserable in the thought of what her sister had to endure .
They came .
The family was gathered in the breakfast room to receive them .
Smiles lit up Mrs. Bennet's face as the car came to the door; her husband seemed impenetrably grave; his daughters , worried , anxious , worried .
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was opened , and she ran into the room .
His mother came forward , kissed him , and greeted him with delight; she held out her hand , with an affectionate smile , to Wickham , who was following his lady; and wished them both joy with an eagerness that left no doubt about their happiness .
Their reception of Mr. Bennet , whom they then shot , was not so cordial .
His face was more austere; and he has barely opened his lips .
The easy insurance of the young couple was indeed enough to provoke him .
Elizabeth was disgusted , and even Miss Bennet was shocked .
Lydia was still Lydia; untamed , uninhibited , wild , noisy and fearless .
She turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations; and when at last they all sat down , looked eagerly around the room , noticed little slight alteration in it , and observed , laughing , that it was a great moment since it had been there .
Wickham was no more anxious than herself , but his manners were always so agreeable , that if his character and marriage had been exactly what they needed , his smiles and his easy address , while affirming their relationship , would have delighted them all .
Elizabeth had not believed him quite capable of such assurance; but she sat down , resolving herself to no longer limit the impudence of an impudent man .
She blushed , and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion did not suffer any variation of color .
There was no lack of speech .
The bride and her mother could not speak fast enough; and Wickham , who was sitting near Elizabeth , began to inquire about her acquaintance in that neighborhood , with a good-humored humor that she felt unable to match in her answers .
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories of the world .
Nothing of the past was collected with pain; and Lydia voluntarily directed subjects that her sisters would not have mentioned to the world .
" Just think that she's three months old , "  she cried ,  " since I left , it seems to me that I've only had a fortnight , and yet enough has happened in the weather .
Good grace !
when I left , I'm sure I had no idea to be married until my return !
although I thought it would be very fun if I was .  " 
His father looked up .
Jane was in distress .
Elizabeth looked at Lydia with an expressive air; but she , who has never heard or seen anything of which she has chosen to be insensitive , continued cheerfully ,  " Oh !
Mom , do people know that I'm married today ?
I was afraid they would not do it; and we passed William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined that he should know it , and so I lowered the side window next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest on the window frame , so that he could see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything .  " 
Elizabeth could not stand it anymore .
She got up and ran out of the room . and she did not come back , until she heard them pass into the dining-room .
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia , with an uneasy parade , climb to the right of her mother and hear her tell her elder sister ,  " Ah !
Jane , I'll take your place now , and you have to go lower , because I'm a married woman .
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment of which she had been so completely free at first .
His ease and good mood have increased .
She wanted to see Mrs. Phillips , the Lucases and all their neighbors , and to hear herself called  " Mrs. Wickham "  by each of them; and meanwhile she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two maids .
" Well , Mom , "  she said , when they were all back in the breakfast room ,  " and what do you think of my husband ?
Is not he a charming man ?
I'm sure my sisters must all envy me .
I only hope they will have half of my luck .
They must all go to Brighton .
This is the place to get husbands .
What a pity , Mom , we did not all go there .
" Very true , and if I had my will , we should .
But my dear Lydia , I do not like you at all that far .
Should it be so ?
" Oh Lord !
yes , there is nothing in there .
I will love him of all things .
You and Dad , and my sisters , must come down and see us .
We will be in Newcastle all winter , and I dare say there will be bullets , and I will make sure I have good partners for everyone .
" I should love him beyond anything ! " 
his mother said .
" And when you leave , you can leave one or two of my sisters behind you , and I dare say that I will find them husbands before the end of the winter . " 
" Thank you personally for the favor , "  said Elizabeth;  " But I do not particularly like the way you get husbands . " 
Their visitors should not stay more than ten days with them .
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before leaving London , and he was to rejoin his regiment after a fortnight .
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay was so short; and she enjoyed most of the time by visiting with her daughter and having very frequent holidays at her house .
These parts were acceptable to all; Avoiding a family circle was even more desirable for those who thought that for those who did not think so .
Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had planned to find; not equal to Lydia for him .
She scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , by the reason of things , that their fugue had been provoked by the force of her love , rather than her own; and she would have wondered why , without caring violently for her , he had chosen to run away with her , if she had not been certain that her flight was made necessary by the distress of the circumstances; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist the opportunity to have a companion .
Lydia loved him very much .
He was his dear Wickham on every occasion; Nobody should be put in competition with him .
He did all the best in the world . and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than anyone else in the country .
One morning , shortly after their arrival , while she was sitting with her two older sisters , she said to Elizabeth ,  " Lizzy , I never told you about my wedding , I think .
You were not there when I told Mom and the others .
Are not you curious to hear how this has been managed ?  " 
" No , really , "  replied Elizabeth;  " I think there can not be too little on the subject . " 
" The !
You are so strange !
But I have to tell you how it went .
We got married , you know , in Saint-Clément , because the Wickham housing was in that parish .
And it was agreed that we would all be there at eleven o'clock .
My uncle , aunt and I were going together; and the others had to meet us at the church .
Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a hustle and bustle !
I was so scared , you know , that something was going on to put him off , and I should have been distracted .
And there was my aunt , all the time I got dressed , preached and talked as if she was reading a sermon .
However , I have not heard more than one word out of ten , because I thought , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham .
I was anxious to know if he would be married in his blue coat .
- Well , we had lunch at ten o'clock as usual , I thought it would never be over because , by the way , you must understand that my uncle and aunt were horribly unpleasant the whole time I was with them  .
If you believe me , I did not put my foot once outside , although I was there a fortnight .
Not a party , or a plan , or anything .
To be sure that London was rather thin , but , however , the little theater was open .
Well , and just as the car was coming to the door , my uncle was called for business by this horrible man , Mr. Stone .
And then , you know , when they meet , there is no end .
Well , I was so afraid that I did not know what to do , for my uncle had to betray me; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not get married all day .
But , fortunately , he came back in ten minutes , and then we all left .
However , I later remembered that if he had been prevented from going , the wedding was not to be postponed , as Mr. Darcy could have done it as well .
" M .
Darcy !  " 
repeated Elizabeth , stupefied .
" Oh , yes ! "   " He had to come with Wickham , you know .
But thanks !
I completely forgot !
I should not have said a word about it .
I promised them so faithfully !
What will Wickham say ?
It must have been such a secret !  " 
" If it were to be secret , "  said Jane ,  " do not say one more word on the subject .
You can count on my search further .  " 
" Oh !
" Certainly , "  said Elizabeth , burning with curiosity ,  " we will not ask you any questions .
" Thanks , "  said Lydia ,  " if you did , I should definitely tell you everything , and then Wickham would be angry . " 
Upon such encouragement to ask , Elizabeth was forced to put him out of her power , by running away .
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try to get information .
Mr. Darcy had been to his sister's wedding .
It was exactly a scene , and exactly among the people , where he apparently had the least to do , and the least temptation to go .
Conjectures as to the meaning of this one , rapid and wild , rushed into his brain; but she was satisfied with no one .
Those who pleased him most , placing his conduct in the highest light , seemed the most improbable .
She could not bear such suspense; and , hastily grabbing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , asking for an explanation of what Lydia had dropped , if it was compatible with the secret that had been planned .
" You can easily understand , "  she added ,  " what must be my curiosity to know how a person unrelated to us , and (relatively speaking) a stranger to our family , should have been among you at such a time .
I beg you to write to me at once , and let me understand it , unless it is , for very convincing reasons , to remain in the secret which Lydia seems to consider necessary; and then I must try to satisfy myself with ignorance .
" It's not that I'm , though , "  she added to herself , as she finished the letter; and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honorable way , I will certainly be reduced to ruses and stratagems to know it .
The delicate sense of Jane's honor did not allow her to speak privately to Elizabeth about what Lydia had let down; Elizabeth rejoices; until he appeared to know whether his inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she preferred to be without confidence .
Chapter 52 Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she could .
She was no sooner in possession than , rushing into the little grove , where she was the least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it contained no denial .
" Gracechurch Street , September 6th .
" MY DEAR NICE "  , I have just received your letter , and I will devote all this morning to answering it , as I foresee that a little writing will not understand what I have to say to you .
I must confess surprised at your request; I did not expect it from you .
Do not think I'm sorry , though , because I just want to let you know that I did not imagine that such investigations would be necessary on your side .
If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence .
Your uncle is as surprised as I am - and just the belief that you were a concerned party would have allowed him to do what he did .
But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I have to be more explicit .
" The very day of my return from Longbourn , your uncle had an unexpected visitor .
Mr. Darcy called , and was locked with him several hours .
Everything was finished before my arrival . So my curiosity was not so terribly muffled that yours seemed to have been so .
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had discovered where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham several times , Lydia once .
From what I can gather , he left Derbyshire a day after us and came to town with the resolution to drive them away .
The professed motive was his conviction that it was to himself that the uselessness of Wickham had not been sufficiently known to prevent a young woman of character from loving or confiding in him .
He generously blamed it on his false pride , and confessed that he had previously thought he was under him to expose his private actions to the world .
His character was to speak for himself .
He , therefore , called upon him to advance and to endeavor to remedy an evil which had been provoked by himself .
If he had another reason , I'm sure it would never dishonor him .
He had been a few days in town before he could discover them; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had; and the awareness of this was another reason for his resolve to follow us .
" There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was formerly governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her office on some cause of disapproval , though he did not say what .
She then took a large house in Edward Street , and has since maintained leaving lodgings .
This Mrs. Younge knew Wickham intimately; and he went to her for the intelligence of him as soon as he arrived at the city .
But it was two or three days before he could get what she wanted from her .
I guess she would not betray her trust without corruption or corruption , because she really knew where her friend was .
Wickham , indeed , had gone to see her on their arrival in London and , if she had been able to receive them at her house , they would have settled at her place .
In the end , however , our amiable friend obtained the desired direction .
They were in ---- street .
He saw Wickham , and then insisted on seeing Lydia .
Her first object with her , he acknowledged , was to persuade her to leave her present dishonorable situation , and to return to her friends as soon as they could be persuaded to receive her , offering her help as far as she could . would go .
But he found Lydia absolutely determined to stay where she was .
She did not take care of any of her friends; she did not want his help; she would not hear of leaving Wickham .
She was sure they should be married at one time or another , and that did not mean much when .
Since this was his feeling , he thought only of securing and accelerating a marriage which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , which he learned easily , had never been his design .
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment because of some debts of honor which were very pressing; and scrupled not to put all the harmful consequences of Lydia's flight on her own madness alone .
He wanted to resign immediately from his commission; and as to his future situation , he could very little conjecture .
He had to go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he would have nothing to live on .
" Mr. Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister immediately .
Although Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he could have done something for him , and his situation should have been fostered by the marriage .
But he found , in answer to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of making his fortune more effectively by marriage to another country .
In such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be evidence against the temptation of immediate reparation .
" They met several times because there was a lot to talk about .
Wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get; but the length has been reduced to be reasonable .
" All that was going on between them , Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle known , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the day before my return home .
But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr. Darcy found , after further investigation , that your father was still with him , but that he would leave the city the next morning .
He did not judge your father as a person whom he could so well consult as your uncle , and he therefore differed from seeing him until after the departure of the first .
He did not leave his name , and until the next day it was only known that a gentleman had done business .
" On Saturday , he came again .
Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a lot of discussions together .
" They saw each other Sunday , and then I saw him too .
Everything was not settled before Monday: as soon as it was the case , the express was sent to Longbourn .
But our visitor was very obstinate .
I believe , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the true defect of one's character , after all .
He has been accused of several faults at different times , but this one is the real one .
There was nothing to be done he did not do; though I am sure of it (and I do not say it to be thanked , so do not say anything about it) , your uncle would have done it very well .
" They fought together for a long time , which was more than the gentleman or lady concerned deserved .
But finally your uncle was obliged to yield , and , instead of being authorized to serve his niece , he was obliged to bear only the probable credit , which went terribly against the current; and I truly believe that your letter this morning was a great pleasure for her , because she needed an explanation which would take away her borrowed pens , and give praise where she was due .
But , Lizzy , it must not go further than you , or Jane at most .
" You know very well , I guess , what has been done for young people .
His debts must be paid , which equates , I believe , to much more than a thousand pounds , a thousand more in addition to his own settled on her , and her commission purchased .
The reason why all this had to be done by him alone was such as I gave it above .
It was to him , to his reserve and lack of consideration , that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood , and therefore that he had been received and noticed as he was .
Perhaps there was truth in this genre; although I doubt whether his reserve , or everyone's reserve , may be responsible for the event .
But , in spite of all these fine words , my dear Lizzy , you can rest assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not attributed to him the merit of another interest in the affair .
When all was settled , he returned again to his friends who were still at Pemberley , but it was agreed that he would be in London again when the marriage took place , and all the questions of money were then to receive the last . finish .
" I think I've told you everything now .
It's a relationship you tell me to give you a big surprise; I hope at least that it will not cause you any discontent .
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house .
He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how unhappy I was with her behavior while she was with us , if I did not perceive , by Jane's letter last Wednesday , that her driving back home was exactly the same . a room , and therefore Now , say that you can not give yourself new pains .
I spoke to her several times in the most serious manner , pointing out to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the misfortune she had brought to her family .
If she heard me , it was by chance , because I'm sure she did not listen .
I was sometimes quite provoked , but I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for them I had patience .
" Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding .
He dined with us the next day and had to leave the city on Wednesday or Thursday .
Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take the opportunity to say (which I have never dared to say) how much I love him .
His behavior towards us was , in all respects , as pleasant as when we were in Derbyshire .
His understanding and his opinions please me all; he wants nothing but a little vivacity , and if he marries carefully , his wife can teach him .
I found him very devious; he hardly ever mentioned your name .
But slyness seems fashionable .
" Forgive me if I have been very presumptuous , or at least do not punish me until I exclude myself from P . I will never be quite happy until I have been around the park .
A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing .
" But I do not have to write more .
The children wanted me this half hour .
" Very sincerely , "  Mr.
GARDINER .  " 
The contents of this letter cast Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain had the greatest share .
The vague and unstable suspicions that uncertainty had aroused of what Mr. Darcy could have done to follow his sister's match , which she had feared to encourage as an effort of kindness too great to be probable , and At the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , have been proved beyond their greatest measure to be true !
He had followed them on purpose to go to town , he had taken upon himself all the pain and mortification which accompanied such a search; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he had to abjure and despise , and where he was reduced to meeting , frequently meeting , reasoning , persuading , and finally bribing , the man whom he always wished to avoid , and whose the very name was a punishment to pronounce .
He had done all this for a girl he could not look at or estimate .
His heart whispered that he had done it for her .
But it was a hope soon thwarted by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when one had to rely on her affection for her - for a woman who had already refused it - as being able to overcome a feeling so natural as the horror against the relationship with Wickham .
Wickham's brother-in-law !
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection .
He had , of course , done a lot .
She was ashamed to think how much .
But he had given a reason for his interference , which did not require an extraordinary extension of belief .
It was reasonable to think he had been wrong; he had the liberality , and he had the means to exercise it; and although she does not think of herself , she might be able to believe that the bias that remains for her might help her in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned .
It was painful , extremely painful , to know that they had obligations to someone who could never receive a refund .
They owed him the restoration of Lydia , her character , everything .
Oh !
how she cried with all her heart all the unpleasant sensations she had encouraged , all the naughty speeches she had addressed to him .
For her she was humiliated; but she was proud of him .
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honor , he had been able to gain control over himself .
She re-read again and again the praises of her aunt .
It was barely enough . but he liked it .
She even felt a certain pleasure , though mixed with regret , to find with what firmness she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence remained between Mr. Darcy and herself .
She was awakened from her seat , and her reflections , by someone's approach; and before she could hit another path , she was overtaken by Wickham .
" I'm afraid to interrupt your solitary walk , my dear sister ?
he said , joining him .
" You certainly do , "  she replied with a smile;  " But it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . " 
" I should be really sorry , if that was the case .
We were always good friends; and now we are better .  " 
" True .
Have the others gone out ?
" I do not know .
Mrs. Bennet and Lydia go in the car to Meryton .
And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you really saw Pemberley .
She replied in the affirmative .
" I envy you almost pleasure , and yet I think it would be too much for me , otherwise I could take it for Newcastle .
And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ?
Poor Reynolds , she still loved me a lot .
But of course , she did not mention my name .
" Yes she did it . " 
" And what did she say ? " 
" That you had gone to the army , and she was scared - not well shot .
At a distance such as that , you know , things are strangely distorted .  " 
" Certainly , "  he replied , biting his lips .
Elizabeth hoped to have shut her up; but he soon said ,  " I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month .
We met each other several times .
I wonder what he can do there .  " 
" Maybe prepare for her marriage with Miss de Bourgh , "  Elizabeth said .
" It must be something special , take him there at this time of year . " 
" Undoubtedly .
Did you see him while you were in Lambton ?
I thought I understood from the Guardians that you had .
" Yes , he introduced us to his sister . " 
" And do you like it ? " 
" A lot . " 
" I have heard , indeed , that it is exceptionally improved during this year or two .
When I saw her for the last time , she was not very promising .
I'm very glad you liked him .
I hope it will be fine  " 
" I dare say she will , she's past the toughest age . " 
" Did you go to Kympton village ? " 
" I do not remember we did it . " 
I mention it because it is the living thing that I should have had .
A very nice place ! - Excellent House Parsonage !
That would have suited me in every respect .  " 
" How would you like to do sermons ? " 
" Very good .
I should have considered this as part of my duty , and the effort would soon have been nothing .
You must not repent , but to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me !
The calm , the retreat of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness !
But he did not have to be .
Have you ever heard Darcy talk about the situation when you were in Kent ?
" I have heard by authority , what I thought was good , that it was left to you only conditionally , and at the will of the present boss .
" You have .
Yes , there was something in that; I told you from the beginning , you may remember .
I also heard that there was a time when the preaching did not please you as it now seems , that you had declared your resolution never to take orders , and that the matter had been compromised accordingly .  " 
" You did it !
and it was not entirely unfounded .
You may remember what I told you about this when we first talked about it .
They were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked quickly to get rid of him; and not wanting to provoke her for her sister's sake , she replied only with a smile of good humor:  " Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know .
Do not let us quarrel over the past .
In the future , I hope we will always agree .  " 
She held out her hand; he kissed her with affectionate gallantry , though he could barely look , and they entered the house .
Chapter 53 Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again grieved nor provoked his dear sister Elizabeth to present the subject; and she was glad to see that she had said enough to keep it quiet .
The day of her departure and that of Lydia soon came , and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation which , as her husband had no intention of going to Newcastle , was to last at least twelve months .
" Oh !
my dear Lydia ,  " cried she , "  when shall we see each other again ?
" Oh Lord !
I do not know .
Not these two or three years , maybe .
" Write to me very often , my dear . " 
" As often as I can .
But you know that married women never have a lot of time to write .
My sisters can write to me .
They will have nothing else to do .  " 
Mr. Wickham's farewells were much more affectionate than those of his wife .
He smiled , was handsome and said a lot of pretty things .
" He's also a good boy , "  said Mr. Bennet , as soon as they were out of the house ,  " as I've ever seen .
He simps , smiles and makes love to us all .
I am prodigiously proud of him .
I even challenge Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more precious son-in-law .
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very boring for several days .
" I often think , "  she says ,  " that there is nothing so bad as to part with one's friends .
We look so desperate without them .  " 
" It's the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a girl , "  said Elizabeth .
" It must make you better satisfied that your four others are single . " 
" It's not such a thing .
Lydia does not leave me because she is married , but only because her husband's regiment is so far away .
If it had been closer , she would not be gone so soon .  " 
But the soulless condition into which this event threw her was soon relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news which then began to circulate .
The governess of Netherfield had been ordered to prepare for the arrival of her master , who would come in a day or two to run there for several weeks .
Mrs. Bennet was quite in the stuff .
She looked at Jane and smiled , shaking her head in turn .
" Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley comes down , sister , "  (for Mrs. Phillips first brought him the news) .
" Well , so much the better .
Not that I care , though .
You know , it's nothing for us and I'm sure I never want to see it again .
But , however , he is welcome to Netherfield , if he likes it .
And who knows what can happen ?
But it's nothing for us .
You know , sister , we agreed a long time ago to never talk about it .
And so , is it quite certain that it is happening ?
" You can count on her , "  said the other ,  " for Mrs. Nicholls was at Meryton last night , I saw her go by , and I went out on purpose to find out the truth , and she told me that he was certain true .
It arrives Thursday at the latest , most likely Wednesday .
She was going to the butcher , she told me , to order meat on Wednesday , and she has three ducks that can be killed .
Miss Bennet had not heard of his coming without changing color .
It had been several months since she had mentioned her name to Elizabeth; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said ,  " I saw you today , Lizzy , when my aunt told us about this report , and I know that I seemed distressed .
But do not imagine it was any idiotic cause .
I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I had to be watched .
I assure you that the news does not affect me with pleasure or pain .
I'm happy with one thing , come alone; because we will see the least of him .
Not that I'm afraid of myself , but I dread others' remarks .
Elizabeth did not know what to do with it .
If she had not seen him in Derbyshire , she might have supposed him to be able to come there with no other view than what was recognized; but she always thought him partial to Jane , and she hesitated on the greater probability that he would come there with the permission of his friend , or that he had the audacity to do without it .
" But it is difficult , "  she thought sometimes ,  " that this poor man can not come to a house he has legally engaged , without raising all these speculations !
I will leave it to himself .  " 
Despite what her sister was saying and really believed her feelings were waiting for her to arrive , Elizabeth could easily see that her mind was affected .
They were more disturbed , more unequal than they had often seen .
The subject that had been so hotly debated between their parents about twelve months ago was now resumed .
" As soon as Mr. Bingley comes , my darling , "  said Mrs. Bennet ,  " you will , of course , expect it .
" Not , not .
You forced me to visit him last year , and I promised , if I went to see him , that he would marry one of my daughters .
But that ended in nothing , and I will not be fired again for a crazy race .
His wife told him how much such attention would be absolutely necessary from all the neighboring gentlemen on his return to Netherfield .
" It's a label that I despise , "  he said .
" If he wants our society , let him seek it .
He knows where we live .
I will not spend my hours chasing my neighbors every time they leave and come back .
" Well , all I know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not expect it .
But , however , that will not stop me from asking him to dine here , I am determined .
We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon .
That will be thirteen with us , so there will be just room for him .
Consoled by this resolution , she was the most capable of enduring the incivility of her husband; but it was very mortifying to know that his neighbors could all see Mr. Bingley , accordingly , before them .
As the day of his arrival approached , -  " I'm starting to be sorry he's coming to all , "  said Jane to her sister .
It would be nothing , I could see it with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it speak so perpetually .
My mother wants to say well; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says .
Happy will I be when his stay in Netherfield is over !
" I wish I could say anything to console you , "  replied Elizabeth;  " But it's completely out of my power .
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a victim is denied me , because you always have so much .
Mr. Bingley has arrived .
Mrs. Bennet , helped by servants , was able to get the first news , that the period of anxiety and sorrow on her side could be as long as she could .
She counted the days that must occur before their invitation can be sent; desperate to see him before .
But the third morning after arriving in Hertfordshire , she saw him , through the window of his bathroom , enter the paddock and head for the house .
His daughters were eagerly called to share his joy .
Jane has resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth , to please her mother , went to the window - she looked - she saw Mr. Darcy with him , and sat down again by his sister .
" There is a gentleman with him , mother , "  said Kitty;  " Who can it be ? " 
" An acquaintance or whatever , my dear , I suppose , I'm sure I do not know . " 
" The ! " 
Kitty replied ,  " It looks like this man who was with him before .
Mr. what is his name .
This tall and proud man .  " 
" Good grace !
M .
Darcy ! - and that's what I do , I swear .
Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley will always be welcome here , to be sure; but I must say that I hate the sight of him .
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern .
She did not know much about their meeting in Derbyshire , and therefore felt the clumsiness that was to accompany her sister , seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter .
The two sisters were quite uncomfortable .
Each felt for the other , and of course for themselves; and their mother spoke , of her dislike of Mr. Darcy , and his resolution of being civic to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend , without being heard by any of them .
But Elizabeth had cause for concern that Jane could not suspect , to whom she had never yet had the courage to show Mrs. Gardiner's letter , or to tell her own change of feeling about her .
For Jane , it could only be a man whose propositions she had rejected and whose merit she had underestimated; but for his part , he was the person to whom the whole family owed his first advantages , and considered herself as interested , if not as tender , at least as reasonable and just as Jane for Bingley .
Her astonishment at her coming - upon her arrival at Netherfield , Longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again - was almost equal to what she had known when she first saw her altered behavior in Derbyshire .
The color that had been thrown off her face returned for half a minute with an extra glow , and a smile of joy added sparkle to her eyes , as she thought for that time that her affection and her desires were to be unshakeable .
But she would not be safe .
" Let's first see how he behaves , "  she said;  " It will be early enough for the wait . " 
She was sitting at work , trying to be calm , and not daring to look up , until an anxious curiosity carried them to her sister's face as the servant approached the door .
Jane looked a little paler than usual , but calmer than Elizabeth had expected .
On the appearance of gentlemen , its color has increased; yet she received them with suitable ease and with a cleanliness of behavior equally free from any symptom of resentment or useless complacency .
Elizabeth said as little to one as civility permitted , and sat down again at work , with an eagerness she did not often command .
She had only dared to glance at Darcy .
He looked serious , as usual; and , she thought , more as he used to look in Hertfordshire than she had seen him at Pemberley .
But perhaps he could not be in the presence of his mother in front of his uncle and aunt .
It was a painful guess , but not improbable .
Bingley , too , had seen him for a moment , and during that short time he saw him both happy and embarrassed .
He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility that shamed his two daughters , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of his reverence and addressed to his friend .
Elizabeth , in particular , who knew that her mother owed to her the preservation of her favorite daughter of irreparable infamy , was hurt and afflicted to a very painful degree by a distinction so badly applied .
Darcy , after asking how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were doing , a question she could not answer without confusion , said almost nothing .
He was not sitting near her; perhaps it was the reason for his silence; but that had not been the case in Derbyshire .
There he had spoken to his friends , when he could not to herself .
But now several minutes have passed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when from time to time , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she lifted her eyes to her face , she often saw him looking at Jane as herself , and frequently on the ground alone  .
More thought and less anxiety to please than during their last meeting , were clearly expressed .
She was disappointed and angry at being so .
" Can I expect it to be otherwise ? " 
she says .
" But why did he come ? " 
She was in no mood to converse with anyone but himself; and to him she scarcely had the courage to speak .
She asked her sister , but could not do more .
" A long time ago , Mr. Bingley , you left , "  said Mrs. Bennet .
He easily accepted .
" I started being afraid that you would never come back again .
People said you wanted to leave the place entirely at Michaelmas; but , however , I hope that is not true .
A lot of changes have occurred in the neighborhood since you left .
Miss Lucas is married and settled .
And one of my own girls .
I suppose you heard about it; indeed , you must have seen it in the newspapers .
It was in the Times and The Courier , I know it; but it has not been put in place properly .
It has only been said , 'Lately , George Wickham , Esq .
to Miss Lydia Bennet , without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything .
It was also my brother Gardiner's drawing , and I wonder how he came to make it so embarrassing .
Have you seen him ? " 
Bingley replied that he did it , and congratulated him .
Elizabeth did not dare to look up .
How Mr. Darcy looked , so she could not say .
" It's a delightful thing , of course , to have a well-bred daughter , "  his mother continued ,  " but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it's very hard to get him so far away from me .
They have come down to Newcastle , a place quite north , it seems , and they are here to stay , I do not know how long .
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his departure from the county , and his departure for the regulars .
Thank God !
he has some friends , but maybe not as much as he deserves .
Elizabeth , who knew that this was equal to Mr. Darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could scarcely keep her seat .
He , however , withdrew the effort of speaking , which nothing else had done so efficiently before; and she asked Bingley if he was planning to stay in the country right now .
A few weeks , he believed .
" When you have killed all your birds , Mr. Bingley , "  said his mother ,  " I beg you to come here , and fire as much as you please on Mr. Bennet's mansion . " 
I am sure he will be very happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you .  " 
The misery of Elizabeth was increasing , to such useless and useless attention !
If the current perspective were the same as the one that flattered them a year ago , all would be persuaded that everything would go to the same vexatious conclusion .
At that moment , she felt that years of happiness could not bring Jane to terms for moments of such painful confusion .
" The first wish of my heart , "  she said to herself ,  " is never again to be in the company of one or the other .
Their society can not afford any pleasure that will expiate such misery !
Let me never see one another again !  " 
Meanwhile misery , for which the years of happiness offered no compensation , soon received a material relief , observing how much the beauty of her sister aroused the admiration of her former lover .
When he entered , he had spoken little to him; but every five minutes seemed to give him more of his attention .
He found it as beautiful as it had been last year; of good nature , and as unaffected , but not quite so talkative .
Jane was keen to see no difference in her and she was sure she was talking as much as ever .
But her mind was so busy that she did not always know when she was silent .
When the gentlemen got up to leave , Mrs. Bennet was aware of her intended civility , and they were invited and hired to dine at Longbourn in a few days .
" You are quite in my debt , Mr. Bingley , "  she added ,  " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to have a family dinner with us upon your return .
I have not forgotten , you see; and I assure you that I was very disappointed that you did not return to keep your engagement .
Bingley seemed a little silly at this thought , and said something of his concern for being prevented by business .
They then left .
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but , although she always kept a very good table , she did not think that two dishes less were good enough for a man on whom she had so anxious designs , or which satisfied the appetite and the pride of someone who had ten thousand a year .
Chapter 54 As soon as they were gone , Elizabeth went out to recover her spirits; or in other words , to remain uninterruptedly on these subjects who must put them to sleep more .
Mr. Darcy's behavior astonished and vexed her .
" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , "  she said ,  " did it come to all ?
She could fix it in any way that gave him pleasure .
He could still be kind , always nice , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town , and why not to me ?
If he fears me , why come here ?
If he does not care about me anymore , why is he silent ?
Teasing , teasing , dude !
I will not think about him anymore .
His resolution was involuntarily maintained for some time by the approach of his sister , who joined her with a happy air , which made her more satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth .
" Now , "  she said ,  " that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy .
I know my own strength and I will never be embarrassed by his coming again .
I'm glad he's having dinner here on Tuesday .
We will then see publicly that , on both sides , we meet only as a common and indifferent knowledge .  " 
" Yes , very indifferent , "  said Elisabeth , laughing .
" Oh , Jane , take care of yourself . " 
" My dear Lizzy , you can not believe me so weak , to be in danger now ?
" I think you're in great danger of making him as in love with you as ever . " 
    They did not see the gentlemen until Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet , meanwhile , yielded to all the happy plans , which the good humor and the common courtesy of Bingley , in the half-hour visit , had revived .
Tuesday , there was a big party gathered at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in a very good time .
When they went to the dining room , Elizabeth eagerly watched to see if Bingley would take the place which , in all their previous parties , had belonged to her , by her sister .
Her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , refrained from inviting her to sit alone .
On entering the room he seemed to hesitate; but Jane turned and smiled; it was decided .
He placed himself near her .
Elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked at her friend .
He had endured her with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that Bingley had been sanctioned to be happy , if she had not seen her eyes also turned to Mr. Darcy , with a half-laughing expression of alarm .
Her behavior towards her sister was such , at supper time , that an admiration which , although more guarded than formerly , persuaded Elizabeth that if left entirely to her , would soon be assured of Jane's happiness and hers  .
Although she had not dared to depend on the consequence , she still enjoyed watching her behavior .
This gave him all the animation of which his minds could boast; because she was not in a happy mood .
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them .
He was on one side of his mother .
She knew how much such a situation would please one or the other , or would bring out one or the other advantage .
She was not close enough to hear their speeches , but she could see how seldom they talked to each other , and how formal and cold they were when they did .
The dishonor of her mother , rendered the meaning of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would at times have given something to have the privilege of telling him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unchained by the whole family .
She hoped that the evening would provide an opportunity to bring them together; that the whole visit would not pass without allowing them to enter into something more conversation than the simple ceremonial greeting at its entrance .
Worried and anxious , the period that passed in the parlor , before the arrival of the gentlemen , was boring and boring to a degree that made it almost incivil .
She looks forward to their entry as the point on which must depend all his luck to enjoy the evening .
" If he does not come to me , then , "  she said ,  " I'll leave her forever .
The gentlemen have come; and she thought that he seemed to have answered his hopes; but unfortunately !
the ladies had gathered around the table , where Miss Bennet was making tea , and Elizabeth pouring coffee , into a confederation so close that there was not a single place near her that would admit a chair .
And as the gentlemen approached , one of the girls approached her more than ever , and said in a low voice:  " Men will not come to separate us , I am determined .
We do not want any of them; do we ? " 
Darcy had moved away from another part of the room .
She followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had barely the patience to help someone to take a coffee; and then was furious with herself for being so stupid !
" A man who has already been refused !
How could I be mad enough to hope for a renewal of his love ?
Is there anyone among the sexes who would not protest against such weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ?
There is no indignity so odious to their feelings !
She was a little revived , however , bringing back her own cup of coffee; and she took the opportunity to say ,  " Is your sister still in Pemberley ?
" Yes , she will stay there until Christmas . " 
" And quite alone ?
Have all her friends left her ?
" Mrs. Annesley is with her .
The rest went to Scarborough , these three weeks .  " 
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wanted to converse with her , he could have a better success .
He stood beside her , however , for a few minutes , in silence; and , finally , on the girl whispering to Elizabeth again , he walked away .
When the tea things were removed , and the game tables placed , the ladies all rose up , and Elizabeth hoped soon to be joined by him , when all his views were overthrown upon seeing him fall victim to his mother's rapacity for the whist  . players , and in a few moments after sitting with the rest of the party .
She has now lost all expectations of pleasure .
They were confined for the evening to different tables , and she had nothing to hope for , but her eyes were so often turned to her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as she did .
Mrs. Bennet had conceived for supper the two gentlemen of Netherfield; but their car was accidentally ordered to the others , and she did not have the opportunity to restrain them .
" Well girls , "  she said , as soon as they were left to themselves ,  " What do you say about the day ?
I think everything went very well , I assure you .
Dinner was as well dressed as anything I have ever seen .
The venison was roasted one turn - and everyone said they have never seen such a big bun .
The soup was fifty times better than that of the last week of the Lucases; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that partridges were remarkably well made; and I suppose he has at least two or three French cooks .
And , my dear Jane , I have never seen you look with more beauty .
Ms . Long said that too , because I asked her if you did not do it .
And what do you think she said elsewhere ?
Oh !
Mrs. Bennet , we'll finally have it in Netherfield .
She did indeed .
I think that Mrs. Long is a creature as alive as ever - and her nieces are very pretty girls , and not at all beautiful: I love them prodigiously .
Mrs. Bennet , on the whole , was in a very good mood; she had seen enough of Bingley's behavior to Jane , to be convinced that she would finally get it; and her hopes of advantage for her family , when in a happy humor , were so far beyond reason , that she was rather disappointed not to see him there again the next day , to make her proposals .
" It was a very pleasant day , "  said Ms . Bennet to Elizabeth .
" The party seemed so well chosen , so appropriate with each other .
I hope we meet again often .  " 
Elizabeth a souri .
" Lizzy , you must not do it .
You must not suspect me .
It mortifies me .
I assure you that I have now learned to appreciate his conversation as a pleasant and reasonable young man , without having a wish beyond .
I am perfectly satisfied , from his present manners , that he has never had the intention of engaging my affection .
It is only that he is blessed with a greater gentleness of address , and a stronger desire for generally pleasant , than any other man .  " 
" You are very cruel , "  said her sister ,  " you will not let me smile , and provoke me at every moment . " 
" In some cases , it's hard to believe ! " 
" And how impossible for others ! " 
" But why would you persuade me that I feel more than I think ? " 
" It's a question I do not know how to answer .
We all love to teach , even if we can only teach what is not worth knowing .
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante .
Chapter 55 A few days after this visit , Mr. Bingley called again , and alone .
His friend had left him this morning for London , but was to return home in ten days .
He sat with them over an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits .
Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but , with many expressions of anxiety , he declared himself engaged elsewhere .
" The next time you call , "  she says ,  " I hope we'll have more luck .
He should be particularly happy at all times , etc .
etc .
; and if she would give him leave , take an early opportunity to wait for them .
" Can you come tomorrow ? " 
Yes , he had no commitment for tomorrow; and his invitation was eagerly accepted .
He came , and in such a good time that the ladies were not dressed .
She ran Madame Bennet into her daughter's room , in her dressing gown , her hair half closed , shouting ,  " My dear Jane , hurry up .
He came - Mr. Bingley came .
He is , indeed .
Hurry up , hurry up .
Here , Sarah , come see Miss Bennet and help her with her dress .
It does not matter Miss Lizzy's hair .  " 
" We'll be down as soon as possible , "  said Jane; but I dare to say that Kitty is one of us , because it was mounted half an hour ago .
" Oh !
hang on Kitty !
What does she have to do with it ?
Come quickly , be quick !
Where is your belt , my dear ?
But when her mother was gone , Jane would not have to go down without one of her sisters .
The same anxiety of having them themselves was visible in the evening .
After tea , Mr. Bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and Mary climbed the stairs to her instrument .
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed , Mrs. Bennet looked and winked at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them .
Elizabeth would not observe it; and when finally Kitty did , she said very innocently ,  " What's the matter mom ?
What are you still winking at me ?
What should I do ? " 
" Nothing child , nothing .
I did not wink at you .  " 
She then rested another five minutes more; but unable to lose such a precious opportunity , she rose abruptly and said to Kitty ,  " Come here , my love , I want to talk to you , "  took her out of the room .
Jane immediately glanced at Elizabeth , who told her of her dismay at such premeditation , and of her supplication that she would not give in to that .
In a few minutes , Ms . Bennet opened the door and shouted ,  " Lizzy , darling , I want to talk to you .
Elizabeth was forced to go .
We may as well leave them alone , you know it; his mother said as soon as she was in the room .
Kitty and I climb the stairs to sit in my box .
Elizabeth did not try to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the room , until she and Kitty were out of sight , and then returned to the living room .
Mrs. Bennet's plans for this day were ineffective .
Bingley was all that was charming except the professed lover of his daughter .
His ease and cheerfulness made him a most agreeable addition to their evening; and he carried with the unofficially ill-judged mother , and heard all his stupid remarks with a particularly grateful indulgence and command of the face of the girl .
He hardly needed an invitation to supper; and before he went away , a pledge was formed , mainly by his own and Mrs. Bennet's means , for her coming next morning to shoot with her husband .
After that day , Jane does not say any more about her indifference .
Not a word passed between the sisters regarding Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed with the happy conviction that everything must be concluded quickly , unless Mr. Darcy returned within the time indicated .
Seriously , though , she felt pretty sure that all this had happened with the help of this gentleman .
Bingley was punctual at his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together , as agreed .
The latter was much nicer than his intended companion .
There was nothing in Bingley of presumption or folly that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him in silence; and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him .
Bingley of course came back with him for dinner; and in the evening , Mrs. Bennet's invention was back to work to keep everyone away from him and his daughter .
Elizabeth , who had a letter to write , entered the breakfast room for this purpose , shortly after tea; because the others were going to sit on cards , she could not be wanted to thwart her mother's plans .
But when she returned to the drawing-room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her great surprise , that there was reason to fear that her mother would have been too ingenious to her .
As she opened the door , she saw her sister and Bingley standing over the hearth as if engaged in serious conversation; and if it had not led to suspicion , the faces of the two , hastily turning away from each other , would have told all .
Their situation was quite embarrassing; but hers she thought was even worse .
Not one syllable has been pronounced by one or the other; and Elizabeth was about to leave , when Bingley , who like the other had sat down , stood up abruptly , and whispering a few words to his sister , came out of the room .
Jane could have no reservation from Elizabeth , where trust would please; and kissing her immediately , grateful with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world .
" It's too much ! " 
she added ,  " way too much .
I do not deserve it .
Oh !
why is not everyone so happy ?
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a joy that words could only mediately express .
Every kindness phrase was a new source of happiness for Jane .
But she did not allow herself to stay with her sister , nor to say the half that remained to be said for the moment .
" I have to go immediately to my mother; "  She cried .
I would not want to defeat his loving solicitude , nor allow him to hear it from anyone but me .
He has already gone to my father's house .
Oh !
Lizzy , knowing that what I have to tell will give so much pleasure to all my dear family !
how would I bring so much happiness !
She then hurried to join her mother , who had deliberately broken the a la carte party , and was sitting on the stairs with Kitty .
Elizabeth , left alone , smiled at the speed and ease with which an affair was definitely settled , which had given them so much suspense and vexation .
" And that , "  said she ,  " is the end of all the anxious circumspection of his friend !
of all the falseness and invention of his sister !
the happiest , the wisest , the most reasonable end !
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley , whose talk with her father had been short and purposeful .
" Where is your sister ? " 
he said hurriedly as he opened the door .
" With my mother on the stairs .
She will be in a moment , I dare say .  " 
He then closed the door and , approaching her , asked for the good wishes and affection of a sister .
Elizabeth honestly and warmly expressed pleasure in the prospect of their relationship .
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then , until her sister had come down , she must listen to all that he had to say about his own happiness , and Jane's perfections; and despite her love , Elizabeth truly believed that all her expectations of bliss were rationally grounded , because they were based on Jane's excellent understanding and super-disposition , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself .
It was an evening without joy common to all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave her face a glow of such a sweet animation that made her more beautiful than ever .
Kitty simulated and smiled , hoping her turn would come soon .
Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approval in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , although she spoke to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manners showed how happy he was .
However , no word passed on his lips , until their visitor took leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said ,  " Jane , I congratulate you .
You will be a very happy woman .  " 
Jane immediately went to him , kissed him and thanked him for his kindness .
" You are a good girl; "  he replied ,  " and I have great pleasure in thinking that you will be so happy .
I have no doubt that you are doing very well together .
Your moods are in no way dissimilar .
You are each of you so consistent that nothing will ever be solved; so easy that every servant will deceive you; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income .  " 
" I hope not .
Imprudence or carelessness with regard to money would be unforgivable in me .  " 
" Exceed their income !
My dear Mr. Bennet , exclaimed his wife , what are you talking about ?
Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and most likely more .  " 
Then addressing his daughter ,  " Oh !
my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy !
I'm sure I will not wink all night .
I knew how it would be .
I always said that it must be so , finally .
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing !
I remember , as soon as I saw him , when he first arrived in Hertfordshire last year , I thought it was likely that you would have to meet .
Oh !
he is the most beautiful young man we have ever seen !
Wickham , Lydia , have all been forgotten .
Jane was beyond the competition her favorite child .
At that moment , she did not care about anything else .
Her younger sisters soon became interested in her for objects of happiness that she could in the future happen .
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged for a few bullets there every winter .
Bingley , from that time , was of course a daily visitor to Longbourn; come frequently before breakfast , and always stay until after supper; except when a barbarous neighbor , who could not be hated enough , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he felt obliged to accept .
Elizabeth now had little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present , Jane had no attention to give to anyone else; but it has been of considerable use to both in these hours of separation which must sometimes occur .
In the absence of Jane , he was always attached to Elizabeth , for the pleasure of speaking of her; and when Bingley was gone , Jane constantly looked for the same way of relief .
" He made me so happy , "  she told him one evening , telling me that he was totally unaware that I was in town last spring !
I did not think it possible .  " 
" I thought so , "  Elizabeth replied .
" But how did he explain it ? " 
" It must have been the case of his sister .
They certainly were not friends of his acquaintance with me , which I can not be surprised , since he could have chosen much more advantageously in many ways .
But when they see , as I hope they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be satisfied , and we will be on good terms again; although we can never be what we were for each other .
" It's the most ruthless speech , "  said Elizabeth ,  " that I've heard you say before .
Good girl !
In truth , it would upset me to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's supposed look .
" Would you believe , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my indifference would have prevented him from coming down again !
He made a small mistake to be sure , but that's to the credit of his modesty .
This naturally introduced Jane's panegyric on her mistrust , and the small value he put on his own qualities .
Elizabeth was happy to see that he had not betrayed his friend's interference; for although Jane had the most generous and indulgent heart in the world , she knew that it was a circumstance which should prejudge her against him .
" I'm certainly the luckiest creature ever ! " 
cried Jane .
" Oh !
Lizzy , why am I so separated from my family and blessed above them all !
If I could only see youy as happy !
If there was another man for you !
" If you were to give me forty men , I could never be happier than you .
Until I have your disposition , your kindness , I can never have your happiness .
No , no , let me change for myself; and , perhaps , if I'm lucky , I could meet another Mr. Collins in time .
The business situation in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret .
Mrs. Bennet had the privilege of whispering to Mrs. Phillips , and she ventured , without permission , to do the same with all her neighbors in Meryton .
The Bennets were quickly declared the most fortunate family in the world , although a few weeks before Lydia had fled for the first time , it was generally found that they were marked for misfortune .
Chapter 56 One morning , about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed , when he and the women in the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of 'a car; and they perceived a chair and four driving the lawn .
It was too early in the morning for the visitors , and the crew did not answer any of their neighbors .
The horses were posted; and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them .
As he was certain , however , that someone would arrive , Bingley won over Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and move away with him into the grove .
They both left , and the conjectures of the three others continued , though with little satisfaction , until the door was opened and their visitor entered .
It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh .
They had , of course , intended to be surprised; but their astonishment exceeded their expectation; and from Mrs. Bennet and Kitty , although she was quite unknown to them , even inferior to what Elizabeth felt .
She entered the room with an air more than usual disagreeable , made no other answer to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word .
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother at the entrance of her lady , but no request for introduction had been made .
Mrs. Bennet , quite astonished , though flattered to have such an important host , received her with the greatest politeness .
After sitting down for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to Elizabeth ,  " I hope you're fine , Miss Bennet .
This woman , I suppose , is your mother .
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was .
And I guess she's one of your sisters .
" Yes , madame , "  said Madame Bennet , delighted to speak to Lady Catherine .
" She is my youngest daughter but one .
My youngest is recently married , and my eldest is somewhere on the land , walking with a young man who , I believe , will soon be part of the family .  " 
" You have a very small park here , "  said Lady Catherine after a short silence .
" It's nothing compared to Rosings , ma'am , I dare say , but I assure you it's much bigger than Sir William Lucas's .
" It must be a very awkward living room for the evening , in summer the windows are full to the west . " 
Mrs. Bennet assured him that they never sat there after dinner , and then added ,  " May I take the liberty of asking your lordship if you have left Mr. and Mrs. Collins . " 
" Yes very well .
I saw them the night before .
Elizabeth now expected her to produce a letter from Charlotte , because it seemed the only probable reason for her calling .
But no letter appeared , and she was completely perplexed .
Mrs. Bennet , with much politeness , begged her sweetheart to refresh herself; but Lady Catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , refused to eat anything; Then , getting up , she said to Elizabeth ,  " Miss Bennet , there seemed to be some sort of little desert on one side of your lawn .
I'd be happy to check it out , if you favor me with your company .
" Go , my dear , "  cried his mother ,  " and show his ladyship about different walks .
I think she will be satisfied with the hermitage .  " 
Elizabeth obeyed and , running in her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs .
As she crossed the hall , Lady Catherine opened the doors of the dining-room and the parlor , and pronounced them , after a short visit , to be suitable rooms .
His car was at the door , and Elizabeth saw that his waiting wife was inside .
They walked in silence along the gravel walk that led to the grove; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort to converse with a woman who was now more than usual insolent and unpleasant .
" How could I think of her as her nephew ? " 
she said , looking at her face .
As soon as they had entered the coppice , Lady Catherine began as follows:  " You can not miss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason for my journey here .
Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come .
Elizabeth looked with unfailing astonishment .
" Indeed , you are mistaken , ma'am .
I have not been able to report the honor of seeing you here .
" Mademoiselle Bennet , "  said his girlfriend irritably ,  " you must know that I am not kidding .
But so sincere that you can choose , you will not find it .
My character has always been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in such a circumstance I will certainly not depart from it .
A report of the most alarming nature reached me two days ago .
I was told that not only was your sister about to be married , but that you , this Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would soon be , after all , united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr. Darcy .
Although I know that it must be an outrageous lie , although I do not blame him as much as to assume the truth , I immediately resolved to leave for this place so that I could share my feelings .
" If you think that it is impossible to be true , "  said Elizabeth , blushing with astonishment and disdain ,  " I wonder if you have taken the trouble to come so far .
What could your Lordship propose ?
" From the outset , insist that this report be universally contradicted . " 
" Your coming to Longbourn , to see us and my family , "  said Elizabeth coldly ,  " will be rather a confirmation of him , if , indeed , such a relationship exists . " 
" And !
Do you pretend to ignore it ?
Was it not distributed industrially by yourselves ?
Do you not know that such a report is broadcast abroad ?
" I never heard it was . " 
" And can you also state that there is no foundation for that ? " 
I do not pretend to have the same frankness with your lordship .
You can ask questions that I will not choose to answer .  " 
" It must not be supported .
Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied .
Has he , to my nephew , made a marriage offer ?
" Your lordship said it was impossible . " 
" It must be so , it must be so , while retaining the use of his reason .
But your arts and your seductions may , in a moment of excitement , make him forget what he owes to himself and to his whole family .
You may have attracted him .  " 
" If I do , I'll be the last person to admit it . " 
" Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ?
I have not been used to such language .
I am almost the closest relationship he has in the world and I have the right to know all his most cherished concerns .
" But you do not have the right to know mine , and such behavior will never induce me to be explicit . " 
" Let me be well understood .
This match , which you have the presumption of aspiring , can never take place .
No never .
Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter .
Now what do you have to say ?  " 
" Only this , if it is , you can have no reason to suppose that it will make me an offer . " 
Lady Catherine hesitated a moment , then replied:  " The engagement between them is of a particular kind .
From their childhood , they were meant for each other .
It was his mother's favorite wish , as well as his own .
While in their cradles we plan the union: and now , when the wishes of the two sisters are fulfilled in their marriage , be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and totally allied to the family !
Do you ignore the desires of his friends ?
To his tacit engagement with Mlle de Bourgh ?
Are you lost to every sense of propriety and delicacy ?
Did you not hear me say that in his early days he was destined for his cousin ?
" Yes , and I had heard it before .
But what is it for me ?
If there is no other objection to my marriage with your nephew , I will certainly not be prevented from knowing that his mother and aunt have wished to marry Mlle . De Bourgh .
You both did everything you could to plan the wedding .
Its completion depended on others .
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honor nor inclination for his cousin , why does he not make another choice ?
And if I'm that choice , why can not I accept it ?  " 
Because honor , decorum , prudence , no , interest , forbid it .
Yes , Miss Bennet , interest; for you do not expect to be noticed by his family or his friends , if you act voluntarily against the inclinations of all .
You will be censured , despised and scorned by all who are related to him .
Your alliance will be a shame; Your name will never be mentioned by any of us .  " 
" These are great misfortunes , "  said Elizabeth .
" But Mr. Darcy's wife must have such extraordinary sources of happiness , necessarily attached to her situation , that she can not , on the whole , have any reason to repent .
" Stubborn , stubborn girl !
I'm ashamed of you !
Is this your gratitude for my attentions last spring ?
Is nothing due to me on this point ?
Let us sit down .
You must understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with determined resolve to achieve my goal; I will not be dissuaded either .
I have not been used to the whims of a person .
I have not used to endure disappointment .  " 
" This will make the situation of your Lordship more pitiful , but it will have no effect on me . " 
" I will not be interrupted .
Listen to me silently .
My daughter and my nephew are trained for each other .
They descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line; and at the father's place , respectable , honorable , and ancient families , though without title .
Their fortune on both sides is splendid .
They are destined for one another by the voice of all the members of their respective houses; and what divides them ?
The backward claims of a young woman without family , without ties , without fortune .
Is to endure !
But he must not , must not be .
If you were sensitive to your own good , you would not want to leave the sphere in which you were raised .
" By marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself abandoning this sphere .
He is a gentleman; I am the daughter of a gentleman; until now , we are equal .  " 
" True .
You are the daughter of a gentleman .
But who was your mother ?
Who are your uncles and your aunts ?
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition .  " 
" Whatever my links , "  said Elizabeth ,  " if your nephew does not object to them , they may have nothing to you . " 
" Tell me once and for all , are you betrothed to him ?
Although Elizabeth did not , for the sole purpose of compelling Lady Catherine , to answer this question , she could only say , after a moment of deliberation ,  " I am not . " 
Lady Catherine seemed happy .
" And do you promise never to enter into such an engagement ?
" I will not make any promises like that . " 
" Miss Bennet I am shocked and amazed .
I was expecting to find a more reasonable young woman .
But do not fool yourself into a belief that I will never back down .
I will not leave until you give me the insurance I need .
" And I will certainly never give it .
I must not be intimidated into something so completely unreasonable .
Your lordship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but if I made the desired promise to you , would their marriage be more likely ?
Assuming he's attached to me , would not my refusal to accept his hand make him want to give it to his cousin ?
Let me say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application has been misjudged .
You have largely misunderstood my character , if you think that I can be worked by such persuasions .
To what extent your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I can not say; but you certainly do not have the right to take care of mine .
I must not be bothered further on the subject .
" Not so hurry , please .
I have never done .
To all the objections I have already made , I have yet another to add .
I am no stranger to the details of your youngest sister's infamous kidnapping .
I know everything; that the young man married her was a patchwork affair , at the expense of your father and your uncles .
And is such a girl the sister of my nephew ?
Is her husband , the son of the steward of his late father , his brother ?
Sky and earth ! - What do you think ?
Are the shadows of Pemberley so polluted ?
" You can now have nothing more to say , "  she replied resentfully .
" You insulted me in all possible methods .
I must beg to return home .  " 
And she got up talking .
Lady Catherine got up too , and they turned around .
His wife was very angry .
You have no consideration for the honor and credit of my nephew !
Insensitive , selfish girl !
Do not you consider that a connection with you must dishonor it in the eyes of everyone ?
" Lady Catherine , I have nothing to add .
You know my feelings .  " 
" Are you then resolved to have it ? " 
" I did not say anything like it .
I am only resolved to act in this way , which , in my opinion , will be my happiness , without reference to you , nor to any person so completely alien to me .
" It's good .
You refuse to force me .
You refuse to obey the requirements of duty , honor , and gratitude .
You are determined to lose him in the opinion of all his friends and to make him contempt of the world .
" Neither duty , nor honor , nor gratitude , "  replied Elizabeth ,  " any possible claim on me , in this case .
None of these principles would be violated by my marriage to Mr. Darcy .
And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the elder was excited by his marriage with me , it would not give me a moment of anxiety - and the world in general would make too much sense to join the contempt .  " 
" And that's your real opinion !
This is your final resolution !
Very good .
I will now know how to act .
Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will always be satisfied .
I came to try you .
I hoped to find you reasonable; but , depend on it , I will bear my point .  " 
In this manner Lady Catherine spoke until they were at the door of the carriage , and , turning round quickly , she added:  " I will not leave you , Miss Bennet .
I send no compliments to your mother .
You do not deserve such attention .
I am the most seriously unhappy .  " 
Elizabeth did not answer; and , without trying to persuade her daughter-in-law to return to the house , she engaged quietly .
She heard the car drive away as she climbed the stairs .
Her mother was waiting impatiently at the bathroom door to ask why Lady Catherine would not come back to rest .
" She did not choose it , "  said her daughter ,  " she would go . " 
" She is a very beautiful woman !
and his vocation here was prodigiously civil !
for it came , I suppose , only to tell us that the Collins were good .
She's on her way somewhere , I dare say , and so , through Meryton , she thought she might as well appeal to you .
I guess she had nothing special to tell you , Lizzy ?
Elizabeth was forced to give a little lie here; for to recognize the substance of their conversation was impossible .
Chapter 57 The discomposition of minds to which this extraordinary visit cast Elizabeth could not easily be overcome; she could not , for several hours , learn to think less of it than before .
Lady Catherine , apparently , had taken the trouble of this trip from Rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy .
It was a rational plan , to be sure !
but from what the report of their engagement might have come , Elizabeth was incapable of imagining; she remembered that she was Bingley's intimate friend , and that she was Jane's sister , that was enough , at a time when waiting for a wedding meant that everyone wanted another , to provide the idea .
She had not forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister had to bring them closer together .
And her Lucas Lodge neighbors , therefore (because through their communication with the Collins , the report , she concluded , had reached Lady Catherine) , had only fixed that as almost certain and immediate , that she had waited as far as possible future time .
Turning Lady Catherine's expressions , however , she could not help feeling uneasy about the possible consequence of her persistence in this interference .
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , Elizabeth thought she had to meditate a request to her nephew; and how she could take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she did not dare to pronounce .
She did not know the exact degree of her affection for her aunt , nor her dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of his dignity than she could do; and he was certain that by enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate relations were so unequal with his , his aunt would address him on his weakest side .
With his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which had seemed weak and ridiculous to Elizabeth , contained a lot of good sense and sound reasoning .
If he had previously hesitated about what he had to do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and supplication of such a close relative could solve all the doubts , and determine it at once to be as happy as the unblemished dignity could do it .
In that case , he would not come back .
Lady Catherine could see him on his way through the city; and his commitment to Bingley to return to Netherfield must give way .
" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should happen to his friend in a few days , "  she added ,  " I will know how to understand it .
I will then give any expectation , any desire for its constancy .
If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he could have obtained my affections and my hand , I will soon cease to regret him at all .
    The surprise of the rest of the family , hearing who their visitor was , was very great; but they obligingly satisfied her , with the same kind of supposition which had appeased the curiosity of Mrs. Bennet; and Elizabeth was spared much teasing on the subject .
The next morning , as she was coming down the stairs , she was greeted by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand .
" Lizzy , "  he said ,  " I was going to get you , come to my room .
She followed him there; and his curiosity to know what he had to say to him was exacerbated by the supposition that it was somehow related to the letter he held .
It suddenly seemed to her that she could come from Lady Catherine; and she foresaw with dismay all the explanations which flowed from it .
She followed her father to the fireplace , and they both sat down .
He then said ,  " I received a letter this morning that surprised me excessively .
As this concerns you mainly , you must know its contents .
I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of marriage .
Allow me to congratulate you for a very important conquest .  " 
The color now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instant conviction of being a nephew's letter , instead of the aunt's; and she was indeterminate , whether she was enchanted at his explanation or because she was offended that her letter was not addressed to her; when his father continued:  " You look conscious .
Young girls have a great penetration in these fields; but I think I can defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer .
This letter is from Mr.
Collins .  " 
" From Mr. Collins !
and what can he say ?
" Something very good for the purpose of course .
He begins by congratulating the nuptials who are approaching my eldest daughter , of whom , it seems , he has been informed by some good talkative Lucases .
I will not be impatient to read what he says on this point .
What's relevant to you is this:  " After having offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a little word about a other; which we have been announced by the same authority .
Your daughter Elizabeth , it is assumed , will not long be called Bennet , after her older sister has resigned , and the chosen partner of her destiny can be reasonably considered one of the most illustrious personages in this country .
" Can you guess , Lizzy , who does that mean ?
This young man is blessed , in a special way , with all that the heart of the mortal can wish for: a splendid property , noble parents and extended patronage .
Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of the evils which you might incur by hastily closing the propositions of this gentleman , whom , of course , you will be inclined to profit immediately .
" Do you have an idea , Lizzy , who is this gentleman ?
But now he goes out:  " 'My motive for warning you is this .
We are right in thinking that her aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look at the match with a friendly eye .
" M .
Darcy , see , it's the man !
Now , Lizzy , I think I surprised you .
Could he , or the lucases , throw himself on a man of the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given more lie to what they were telling ?
Mr. Darcy , who never looks at a woman but to see a stain , and who has probably never looked at you in her life !
It's admirable !
Elizabeth tried to join her father's joke , but could only force a very reluctant smile .
Never had her mind been so unpleasantly directed to her .
" Are not you hijacked ? " 
" Oh !
Yes .
Please read .  " 
" After mentioning the possibility of this marriage with her Lordship last night , she immediately expressed , with her habitual condescension , what she felt on occasion when it became apparent that in terms of certain objections from the from my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she called a shameful match .
I thought that it was my duty to inform my cousin as expeditiously as possible , that she and her noble admirer would know what it was about and not rush into a marriage that was not properly sanctioned .
Mr. Collins adds ,  " I am delighted that my cousin Lydia's sad affairs have been so thoroughly suppressed , and I only worry that their common life before marriage is so widely known .
I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or abstain from declaring my astonishment to learn that you received the young couple at home as soon as they got married .
It was an encouragement of vice; and if I had been the rector of Longbourn , I would oppose it vigorously .
You must certainly forgive them , as a Christian , but never admit them to your eyes , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing .
This is his notion of Christian forgiveness !
The rest of his letter concerns only the situation of his dear Charlotte and his expectation of a young olive branch .
But , Lizzy , you do not seem to like him .
I hope you will not be misled , and that you will pretend to be offended by an inactive report .
What are we living for , but playing sports for our neighbors and laughing at them ?
" Oh ! " 
exclaimed Elizabeth ,  " I am extremely distracted .
But it's so strange !  " 
" Yes - that's what makes it fun .
If they had fixed on another man , it would have been useless . but this perfect indifference and this sharp aversion render it so deliciously absurd !
Although I am abusing writing , I would not abandon Mr. Collins' correspondence for any consideration .
No , when I read one of his letters , I can not help giving him the same preference on Wickham , just as I appreciate the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law .
And pray , Lizzy , what did Lady Catherine say about this report ?
Did she call to refuse her consent ?
At this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as she had been asked without the slightest suspicion , she was not upset by her repetition .
Elizabeth had never been more embarrassed to show her feelings than they were .
You had to laugh , when she'd rather cry .
His father had cruelly mortified him by what he said about Mr. Darcy's indifference , and she could only marvel at such a lack of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of seeing too much little , she would have loved too much .
Chapter 58 Instead of receiving such a letter of apology from his friend , as Elizabeth expected Mr. Bingley to do , he was able to take Darcy with him to Longbourn , several days after Lady Catherine's visit .
The gentlemen arrived early; and before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him that they had seen his aunt , whose daughter was in a momentary terror , Bingley , who wanted to be alone with Jane , suggested that they all go out .
It was agreed to .
Mrs. Bennet was not used to walking; Mary could never waste her time . but the remaining five leave together .
Bingley and Jane , however , soon allowed the others to get ahead of them .
They were late , while Elizabeth , Kitty , and Darcy entertained each other .
Very little has been said by one or the other; Kitty was too scared of him to speak; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and maybe he would do the same thing .
They walked to the Lucases , because Kitty wanted to appeal to Maria; and as Elizabeth did not see an opportunity to make it a general preoccupation , when Kitty left them , she continued boldly with him alone .
The time had come to execute her resolution , and while her courage was great , she immediately said ,  " Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and , to relieve my own feelings , do not worry how much I can hurt yours .
I can not thank you for your kindness without example to my poor sister .
Since I have known him , I have been very anxious to recognize you how grateful I feel him .
If she was known to the rest of my family , I would not just have to express my own gratitude .
" I'm sorry , extremely sorry , "  replied Darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion ,  " that you have never been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have made you uncomfortable .
I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so untrustworthy .  " 
" You must not blame my aunt .
Lydia's carelessness at first betrayed me that you had been concerned about the affair; and , of course , I could not rest until I knew the details .
Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for the generous compassion that made you feel so painful and so mortifying to find out .
" If you thank me , "  he replied ,  " it is for you alone .
That the desire to give you happiness can add strength to the other incentives that guided me , I will not try to deny .
But your family does not owe me anything .
Although I respect them , I think I only thought of you .
Elizabeth was too embarrassed to say a word .
After a short pause , his companion added ,  " You are too generous to play with me .
If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me right away .
My affections and desires are unchanged , but a word from you will silence me forever .
Elizabeth , feeling all the more the common awkwardness and anxiety of her situation , forced herself to speak; and immediately , without much difficulty , he made him understand that his feelings had undergone such a substantial change , since the period to which he was alluding , that he made him receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances .
The happiness that this answer produced was such that he had probably never felt it before; and he expressed himself on this occasion as reasonably and as warmly as a violently amorous man might be supposed to do .
If Elizabeth had been able to meet her eye , she could have seen how the expression of sincere joy , spread over his face , became him; but , although she could not look , she listened , and spoke to her of sentiments which , by proving the importance which she had for him , made each moment more precious to her affection .
They walked , without knowing in which direction .
There was too much to think , and felt , and said , for attention to all the other objects .
She soon learned that they owed their understanding to the efforts of her aunt , who invited her on her return to London , and recounted her journey to Longbourn , her motive , and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling insistently on every expression of it , which , in the apprehension of her lady , singularly pointed out her perversity and her assurance; in the belief that such a relationship should help him in his efforts to get that promise from his nephew that she had refused to give .
But , unfortunately for his ladyship , his effect had been exactly the opposite .
" It taught me to hope , "  he said ,  " as I had never ventured to hope before .
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , if you had been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have recognized Lady Catherine , frankly and openly .
Elizabeth colored and laughed as she replied ,  " Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of thatthat .
After abusing you so abominably in your face , I would have no qualms about abusing you in all your relationships .
What did you say about me , that I did not deserve ?
Because , although your accusations were ill-founded , formed in mistaken premises , my behavior towards you at the time had deserved the most severe reprimands .
It was unforgivable .
I can not think of it without horror .  " 
" We will not quarrel for much of the blame attached to this evening , "  said Elizabeth .
" The conduct of both of us , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable , but since then we have both , I hope , improved civility . " 
" I can not be so easily reconciled with myself .
The memory of what I said then , of my conduct , of my manners , of my expressions during all this time , is now , and for several months painfully inexpressible to me .
Your reprimand , so well applied , I will never forget: you behaved in a more gentlemanly way .
These are your words .
You do not know , you can hardly conceive , how they tortured me - although it took a while , I admit , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice .
" I was certainly very far from expecting them to make such a strong impression .
I did not have a clue of ever being smelled in such a way .  " 
" I can easily believe it .
You thought I had no sense , I'm sure you did .
I will never forget the turn of your physiognomy , since you have said that I can not speak to you in a way that would lead you to accept me .
" Oh !
do not repeat what I said then .
These memories will not do at all .
I assure you that I have been ashamed for a long time .
Darcy mentioned his letter .
He said , did that make you think of me soon ?
Have you , reading it , given credit to its contents ?
She explained what her effect on her had been , and how gradually all her previous prejudices had been removed .
" I knew , "  he says ,  " that what I wrote must hurt you , but it was necessary .
I hope you destroyed the letter .
There was mostly a part , the opening , which I dreaded that you have the power to reread .
I remember some expressions that could make you hate rightly .
" The letter will certainly be burned , if you think it essential to maintain my esteem , but , although we have at the same time to think that my opinions are not absolutely unalterable , they are not , I hope , so easily changed .  " 
" When I wrote this letter , "  Darcy replied ,  " I thought myself perfectly calm and cool , but I have since been convinced that it was written in a frightful bitterness of the mind . " 
" The letter , perhaps , started in bitterness , but it did not finish as well .
Farewell is charity itself .
But do not think about the letter anymore .
The feelings of the person who wrote and the one who received it are now so different from what they were then , that any unpleasant circumstances that accompany it must be forgotten .
You must learn some of my philosophy .
Think only of the past as its memory gives you pleasure .  " 
" I can not give you credit for a philosophy like that .
Your retrospections must be absolutely devoid of reproach , that the satisfaction which results from it is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence .
But with me , that's not the case .
Painful memories will be introduced that can not , which should not , be rejected .
I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , but not in principle .
As a child , I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my mood .
I was given good principles , but I left to follow them in pride and vanity .
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , although good (my father , especially , all that was benevolent and kind) , allowed , encouraged , almost learned to be selfish and authoritarian; not taking care of anyone beyond my family; think badly of all the rest of the world; to at least think of their meaning and value in relation to mine .
Such were eight to eight and twenty; and such as I could have been but for you , dear , the most beautiful Elizabeth !
What do I not owe you !
You taught me a lesson , difficult at first , but very advantageous .
By you , I was humiliated .
I have come to you without doubt from my reception .
You showed me how insufficient my pretensions were to please a woman worthy of being satisfied .
" Did you then believe that I should ? " 
" Indeed I had .
What will you think of my vanity ?
I thought you wanted to , wait for my addresses .
" My manners must have been at fault , but not intentionally , I assure you .
I have never intended to deceive you , but my mind can often misbehave .
How did you have to hate me after this evening ?
" Hate you !
I may have been angry at first , but my anger soon began to take appropriate direction .  " 
I'm almost afraid to ask what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley .
You blamed me for coming ?
" No , indeed , I felt only surprise . " 
" Your surprise could not be greater than mine by being noticed by you .
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due .
" My purpose then , "  answered Darcy ,  " was to show you , by all politeness in my power , that I was not so wicked as to have felt the past , and I hoped to obtain your pardon , to diminish your bad opinion , leaving you see that your reproaches have been respected .
How many times other wishes have come forward , I can hardly say , but I believe in about half an hour after I saw you .  " 
He then told him of Georgiana's joy in his acquaintance , and of his disappointment at his sudden interruption; Which naturally led to the cause of this interruption , she soon learned that her resolve to follow her from Derbyshire in search of her sister had been formed before he left the inn , and that his gravity and attention had arisen other struggles that such a goal must understand .
She again expressed her gratitude , but it was a subject too painful for each of them , to extend further .
After having traveled several miles quietly , and too busy to know anything about it , they finally found , while examining their watches , that it was time to be at home .
" What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ! " 
was a wonder who introduced the discussion of their affairs .
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the first information .
" I have to ask if you were surprised ? " 
this Elizabeth .
" Not at all .
When I left , I felt that it was going to happen soon .  " 
" That is to say , you gave your permission .
I guessed it so much .  " 
And although he exclaimed at the end , she found that it was pretty much the case .
" The day before I left for London , "  he said ,  " I made him a confession which I think I must have made for a long time .
I told him everything that had happened to make my former intervention in his affairs absurd and impertinent .
His surprise was great .
He had never had the least suspicion .
I told him , moreover , that I thought I was mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to her; and as I could easily feel that her attachment to her was relentless , I felt no doubt about their happiness together .  " 
Elizabeth could not help but smile in her easy way of directing her friend .
" Have you spoken about your own observation , "  she said ,  " when you told her that my sister liked it , or simply by my information , last spring ?
" From the old .
I had watched it closely during the two visits I had made recently here; and I was convinced of his affection .  " 
" And your insurance , I suppose , bore an immediate conviction to him . " 
" It made .
Bingley is the most modestly modest .
His mistrust prevented him from relying on his own judgment in such an anxious case , but his confidence in mine made everything easy .
I was forced to confess something that , for a time , and not unfairly , offended him .
I could not allow myself to hide that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and that I had voluntarily kept it .
He was angry .
But his anger , I'm sure , did not last longer than there was any doubt about your sister's feelings .
He really forgave me now .  " 
Elizabeth was anxious to point out that Mr. Bingley had been a very good friend; so easily guided that its value was invaluable; but she checked herself .
She remembered that he had not yet learned to make fun of him and that it was too early to start .
Anticipating Bingley's happiness , which , of course , had to be inferior to his , he continued the conversation until they reached the house .
In the hall , they parted .
Chapter 59  " My dear Lizzy , where can you walk ? " 
It was a question Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room , and from all the others when they sat down to eat .
All she had to say was that they had walked around until she was beyond her own knowledge .
She colored as she spoke; but neither that nor anything else awakened a hint of truth .
The evening passed quietly , without being marked by anything extraordinary .
The recognized lovers spoke and laughed , the unrecognized were silent .
Darcy was not of a disposition where happiness overflowed with joy; and Elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather preferred that she was happy than to feel herself; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her .
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation was known; she knew that no one loved her but Jane; and even feared that with the others it would be an aversion that all his fortune and all his fortune could not erase .
At night , she opened her heart to Jane .
Although mistrust was far removed from Miss Bennet's general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here .
" You're joking , Lizzy .
It can not be ! - betrothed to Mr. Darcy !
No , no , you will not fool me .
I know it's impossible .  " 
" It's a miserable start indeed !
My only dependence was on you; and I'm sure no one else will believe me , if you do not believe it .
Yet , indeed , I am serious .
I speak nothing but the truth .
He still loves me , and we are engaged .  " 
Jane looked at her hesitantly .
" Oh , Lizzy !
it can not be .
I know how much you do not like it .
" You do not know anything about the case .
All this is to be forgotten .
Maybe I did not always like him as well as I do now .
But in such cases , a good memory is unforgivable .
This is the last time I will remember it myself .
Miss Bennet always seemed surprised .
Elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of her truth .
" Good heaven !
can it really be so !
Now I must believe you ,  " cried Jane .
" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would - I congratulate you - but are you sure ?
forgive the question - are you sure you can be happy with him ?  " 
" There can be no doubt about it .
It is already established between us that we are the happiest couple in the world .
But are you happy , Jane ?
Would you like to have such a brother ?
" Really really a lot .
Nothing could give Bingley or myself more pleasure .
But we considered it , we talked about it as impossible .
And do you really like it pretty well ?
Oh , Lizzy !
do anything rather than get married without affection .
Are you sure you feel what you should do ?
" Oh yes !
You will only think of feeling more than I should , when I tell you everything .
" What do you mean ? " 
" Why , I must admit I like him better than me Bingley .
I'm afraid you're angry .
" My dear sister , now serious .
I want to talk very seriously .
Let me know everything I need to know , without delay .
Do you want to tell me how long you have loved him ?
" It started so slowly , that I almost do not know when it started .
But I think I must date it from my first visit to Pemberley .
Another prayer that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment .
Convinced of this article , Miss Bennet had nothing to wish .
" Now I am happy enough , "  she said ,  " for you will be as happy as me .
I have always had value for him .
If it were only for his love for you , I would have always esteemed him; but now , as a friend of Bingley and your husband , there can only be Bingley and yourself more dear to me .
But Lizzy , you were very cunning , very reserved with me .
Since you did not tell me much about what happened at Pemberley and Lambton !
I owe everything I know to another , not to you .
Elizabeth told him the reasons for his secret .
She did not want to talk about Bingley; and the troubled state of his own feelings had also made him avoid the name of his friend .
But now she would not hide her part in Lydia's marriage anymore .
Everything was recognized , and half of the night spent in the conversation .
     " Good grace ! " 
exclaimed Mrs. Bennet , as she was standing at a window the next morning ,  " if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy will not come back here with our dear Bingley !
What can it mean to be so boring as to always come here ?
I had no idea but he was going to shoot , or something like that , and not disturb us with his company .
What will we do with him ?
Lizzy , you have to leave with him so that he is not in Bingley's way .
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at such a convenient proposal; however , he was really upset that his mother would always give him such an epithet .
As soon as they entered , Bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth that he left no doubt about his good information . and he soon afterwards said aloud ,  " Mrs. Bennet , do you have more alleys in which Lizzy can lose her way again today ? " 
" I advise Mr. Darcy , Lizzy , and Kitty , "  says Mrs. Bennet ,  " to go to Oakham Mount this morning .
It's a beautiful walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view .  " 
" It may be fine for others , "  said Mr. Bingley;  " But I'm sure it will be too much for Kitty .
Is not it , Kitty ?
Kitty owned that she preferred to stay at home .
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view of the Mount , and Elizabeth silently consented .
As she climbed the stairs to get ready , Mrs. Bennet followed her , saying ,  " I'm really sorry , Lizzy , that you have to have this unpleasant man for you .
But I hope you do not mind: it's for Jane's sake , you know; and there is no opportunity to talk to him except from time to time .
So do not be embarrassed .  " 
During their walk , it was decided that Mr. Bennet's consent should be requested during the evening .
Elizabeth reserved the request for her mother .
She could not determine how her mother would take him; sometimes doubting that all his wealth and greatness would be enough to overcome his horror of man .
But whether she was violently attached to the match , or that she was violently ravished , it was certain that her manners would be so little suited to honor her meaning; and she could no longer bear that M . Darcy heard the first raptures of his joy , the first vehemence of his disapprobation .
    In the evening , shortly after Mr. Bennet retired to the library , she saw Mr. Darcy also get up and follow him , and his agitation at seeing him was extreme .
She did not fear the opposition of her father , but he was going to be unhappy; and that should be by her means - that she , her favorite child , should be distressed by her choice , should fill her with fears and regrets by disposing of her - was a miserable reflection , and she sat in the misery until Mr. Darcy came back , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by her smile .
After a few minutes he went to the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and while pretending to admire her work , she said in a low voice:  " Go to your father's , he wants you in the library . " 
She was gone directly .
His father was walking around the room , looking serious and anxious .
" Lizzy , "  he said ,  " what are you doing ?
Are you devoid of meaning to accept this man ?
You have not always hated him ?
Since she was anxious then that her earlier opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate !
This would have saved him from explanations and professions which were exceedingly difficult to give; but they were now necessary , and she assured him , with some confusion , of his attachment to Mr. Darcy .
Or , in other words , you are determined to have it .
He's rich , of course , and you can have more beautiful clothes and cars than Jane .
But will they make you happy ?  " 
" Do you have another objection , "  said Elizabeth ,  " your belief in my indifference ?
" Not at all .
We all know that he is a proud and unpleasant man; but it would be nothing if you really loved him .
" I do it , I like it , "  she replied , with tears in her eyes ,  " I love her .
Indeed , he has no improper pride .
He is perfectly kind .
You do not know what he really is; so pray do not hurt me by talking about him in such terms .  " 
" Lizzy , "  said his father ,  " I gave him my consent .
He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I would never dare to refuse anything , whom he has deigned to ask .
I give it now to you , if you are resolved to have it .
But let me advise you to think about it better .
I know your disposition , Lizzy .
I know you can not be happy or respectable unless you really value your husband; unless you see him as a superior .
Your bright talents would put you in danger in an unequal marriage .
You could hardly escape discredit and misery .
My child , that I do not have the sorrow to see you unable to respect your partner in life .
You do not know what you're talking about .  " 
Elizabeth , even more affected , was serious and solemn in her reply; and finally , by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of his choice , explaining the gradual change that his estimate of him had undergone , recounting his absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had held the test of several months of suspense , and energetically enumerating all her good qualities , she conquered the incredulity of her father , and reconciled him to the match .
- Well ! My dear , he said , when she stopped talking , I have nothing more to say .
If so , he deserves you .
I could not have separated from you , my Lizzy , for someone less worthy .
To complete the favorable impression , she then told him what Mr. Darcy had done voluntarily for Lydia .
He heard it with astonishment .
" It's an evening of wonders , indeed !
And so , Darcy did everything; did the match , gave the money , paid the comrade's debts , and got him his commission !
All the better .
It will save me a world of problems and economy .
If it had been done by your uncle , I would have paid for it and I would have paid it; but these young violent lovers each carry their own way .
I will offer to pay him tomorrow; he will break loose and embarrass himself with his love for you , and there will be an end to the question .  " 
He then remembered his embarrassment a few days earlier by reading Mr. Collins' letter; and after making fun of her for a while , she finally allowed him to go out of the room and say:  " If young people come for Mary or Kitty , send them , for I am at my leisure .
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved of a very heavy weight; and after half an hour's reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable coolness .
Everything was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed quietly; there was nothing to fear , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time .
When her mother went up to her lodge in the night , she followed her and made the important communication .
His effect was the most extraordinary; for , on hearing it , Mrs. Bennet remained motionless and incapable of pronouncing a syllable .
It was not under many , many minutes that she could understand what she heard; but not usually back to credit what was to the benefit of his family , or who came in the form of a lover to one of them .
She finally began to recover , to fidget in her armchair , to get up , to sit down , to marvel and to bless herself .
" Good grace !
Lord , bless me !
think only !
Dear me !
M . Darcy !
Who would have thought !
And is it really true ?
Oh !
my sweetest Lizzy !
how rich and good you are !
What pin-money , what jewels , what cars you'll have !
Jane's is nothing - nothing at all .
I am so happy - so happy .
A man so charming ! So beautiful !
so big ! - Oh , my dear Lizzy !
I'm sorry for hating me so much .
I hope he will ignore it .
Cher , cher Lizzy .
A house in town !
All that is charming !
Three girls got married !
Ten thousand a year !
Oh Lord !
What will become of me ?
I will go distracted .  " 
This is enough to prove that his approval should not be questioned: and Elizabeth , rejoicing that such a bestowal was heard alone by herself , soon went away .
But before she spent three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her .
" My dear child , "  she cried ,  " I can not think of anything else !
Ten thousand a year , and most likely more !
It's as good as a lord !
And a special license .
You must and must be married by a special license .
But my dear love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy particularly likes , that I can have it tomorrow .
It was a sad portent of what his mother's behavior might be for the gentleman himself; and Elizabeth found that , although in the certain possession of her warmest affection , and sure of the agreement of her relations , there was still something to be desired .
But the next day passed much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet , fortunately , feared so much her projected son-in-law that she dared not speak to him , unless it was in her power to pay attention to him or to show his deference to his opinion .
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father take care to know him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured him that he rose every hour in his esteem .
" I admire all my three stepsons , "  he says .
Wickham , perhaps , is my favorite , but I think I'll love your husband as well as Jane's .
Chapter 60 Elizabeth's spirits soon return to playfulness , she wanted Mr. Darcy to explain why he's already fallen in love with her .
" How could you start ? " 
she says .
" I can understand that you continued so charmingly , when you had already made a start , but what could you explain in the first place ?
" I can not fix at the time , or the place , or the look , or the words , that laid the foundation .
It is too long .
I was in the middle before I knew I had started .
My beauty you resisted early , and as for my manners , my behavior towards you was at least always on the verge of incivility , and I never spoke to you without wanting to make you suffer rather than not .
Now be sincere; Have you admired me for my impertinence ?
" For the liveliness of your mind , I did it . " 
" You may as well call it impertinence at a time .
It was very little less .
The fact is that you were sick of civility , deference , unofficial attention .
You were disgusted by the women who always spoke , and who looked , and who thought only of your approval .
I woke up and I interested you , because I was so different from them .
If you were not really kind , you would have hated me for that; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart you have despised the people who have so diligently courted you .
Here I have spared you the trouble of giving an account of it; and really , all things considered , I'm starting to think it's perfectly reasonable .
Of course , you knew no good of me , but no one thinks about that when they fall in love .
" Was there no good in your loving behavior with Jane when she was sick in Netherfield ? " 
" Dear Jane !
who could have done less for her ?
But make it a virtue by all means .
My good qualities are under your protection , and you must exaggerate them as much as possible; and , in return , it is up to me to find opportunities to mock and quarrel with you as often as possible; and I will start by asking you what made you so unwilling to finally reach the goal .
What made you so shy when you called and dined here ?
Why , especially , when you called , do you seem not to care about me ?
" Because you were serious and silent and you were not encouraged . " 
" But I was embarrassed . " 
" And me too . " 
" You could have talked to me more when you came to dinner . " 
" A man who had felt less , could . " 
" How lucky you are to have a reasonable answer to give , and how reasonable I should be to admit it !
But I wonder how long you would have continued if you had been left to yourself .
I wonder when you would have spoken , if I had not asked you !
My resolution to thank you for your kindness to Lydia has certainly had a great effect .
Too much , I'm afraid; for what becomes of morale if our comfort is born of a rupture of promise ?
because I should not have talked about the subject .
This will never do .  " 
" You do not need to discourage yourself .
Morality will be perfectly right .
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable efforts to separate us were the way to remove all my doubts .
I am not indebted to my present happiness for your ardent desire to express your gratitude .
I was not in the mood to wait for your opening .
The intelligence of my aunt had given me hope , and I was immediately determined to know everything .
Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which must make her happy , because she likes to be useful .
But tell me , why did you come to Netherfield ?
Was it just to go to Longbourn and be embarrassed ?
or did you intend to suffer a more serious consequence ?
" My real purpose was to see you , and judge , if I could , if I ever hoped to make you love .
My attorney , or what I confessed , was to see if your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she was , to make her the confession I have made since .
Would you ever have the courage to tell Lady Catherine what will happen to her ?
" I'm more likely to want more time than courage , Elizabeth .
But that must be done , and if you give me a piece of paper , it will be done directly .
" And if I did not have a letter to write to me , I could sit near you and admire the regularity of your writing , as another girl once did .
But I also have an aunt who should not be more neglected .
Reluctant to admit to how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been overestimated , Elizabeth had never answered Ms . Gardiner's long letter; but now , having to communicate what she knew to be welcome , she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote:  " I would have already thanked you , my dear aunt , as I should have done , for your long , kind , satisfying , detail details , but to tell the truth , I was too cross to write .
You supposed more than really existed .
But now , suppose as much as you want; give free rein to your imagination , give free rein to your imagination in all possible directions , and unless you really believe me married , you can not go wrong .
You must write again very soon , and congratulate him much more than you did in your last one .
Thank you again and again for not visiting the lakes .
How could I be so stupid that I wish it !
Your idea of ​​ponies is lovely .
We will tour the park every day .
I am the happiest creature in the world .
Maybe other people have said it before , but not with such justice .
I am even happier than Jane; she smiles only , I laugh .
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love of the world that he can spare me .
You must all come to Pemberley at Christmas .
Yours , etc .  " 
Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins , in response to his last .
" Dear Sir , "  I must bother you again for congratulations .
Elizabeth will soon be Mr. Darcy's wife .
Lady Catherine console as well as you can .
But , if I were you , I would be next to the nephew .
He has more to give .
" Sincerely yours , etc . " 
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother on the approach of her marriage were all that was affectionate and not sincere .
She even wrote to Jane on this occasion to express her joy and repeat all her old professions of consideration .
Jane was not deceived , but she was affected; and even if she did not trust her , she could not help but write to her an answer much more amiable than she thought deserved .
The joy that Miss Darcy expressed in receiving similar information was as sincere as that of her brother .
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all his joy , and all his sincere desire to be loved by his sister .
Before Mr. Collins received any answer , or Felix congratulated him , the Longbourn family heard that the Collins had come to Lucas Lodge themselves .
The reason for this sudden withdrawal was soon obvious .
Lady Catherine had been so upset by the contents of her nephew's letter , that Charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away until the storm was overthrown .
At this moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure for Elizabeth , although , during their meetings , she sometimes had to think of the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw M . Darcy exposed to all the courtesy of her husband .  .
He endured it , however , with admirable calm .
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas , congratulating him for taking away the most brilliant jewel in the country , and expressing his hopes of meeting frequently at St . James , with a decent calm .
If he shrugged , it was only when Sir William was out of sight .
The vulgarity of Mrs. Phillips was another , and perhaps a larger , tax on her patience; and although Mrs. Phillips , as well as her sister , had too much fear of him to speak with the familiarity that Bingley's cheerfulness encouraged , yet , every time she spoke , she must be vulgar .
She had no respect for him either , even if it made her calmer , making her more elegant .
Elizabeth did everything in her power to protect him from the common opinion of both , and always wanted to keep it for herself and for those of her family with whom he could converse without mortification; and although the uncomfortable feelings that result from it make much of the pleasure of the court , it adds to the hope of the future; and she was looking forward to the moment when they would be removed from society so unpleasant to one or the other , to all the comfort and elegance of their Pemberley family party .
Chapter 61 Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters .
With what delighted pride she then visited Ms . Bingley , and talked about Ms . Darcy , can be guessed .
I wish I could say , for the good of her family , that the accomplishment of her ardent desire to establish so many of her children produced such a happy effect that she made her a sensible , kind , and well-mannered woman . informed for the rest . of his life; but perhaps she was lucky for her husband , who might not have liked domestic bliss in so unusual a form , that she was still sometimes nervous and invariably silly .
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter excessively; her affection for her has attracted her more often from home than anything else could do .
He is looking forward to going to Pemberley , especially when he was least expected .
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelfth month .
So close to his mother and Meryton , his relations were not desirable , even to his easy temper , or to his loving heart .
The cherished vow of her sisters was then gratified; he bought a domain in a neighboring county in Derbyshire , and Jane and Elizabeth , in addition to all other sources of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other .
Kitty , to her material advantage , spent most of her time with her two older sisters .
In a society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great .
She was not as indomitable as Lydia; and , withdrawn from the influence of Lydia's example , she became , by proper attention and direction , less irritable , less ignorant , and less tasteless .
From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society , she was carefully guarded , and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to leave .
Mary was the only girl left at home; and it was necessarily derived from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet being quite incapable of sitting alone .
Mary was forced to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between the beauty of her sisters and hers , her father suspected she was submitting to change without much repugnance .
As for Wickham and Lydia , their characters have not undergone any revolution in the marriage of his sisters .
He supported philosophically the conviction that Elizabeth must now take cognizance of all that was unknown to her and her ingratitude; and , in spite of everything , Darcy could not yet hope to make a fortune .
The letter of congratulation that Elizabeth received from Lydia for her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least , if not by himself , such hope was cherished .
The letter was to this effect:  " MY CHER LIZZY "  , I wish you joy .
If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as me , my dear Wickham , you must be very happy .
It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us .
I'm sure Wickham would really like a place in court , and I do not think we'll have enough money to live without help .
Every place would do , about three or four hundred a year; but , however , do not talk to Mr. Darcy about it , if you prefer not to .
" Yours , etc . " 
As it happened that Elizabeth had far too little , she endeavored , in her reply , to put an end to all the solicitations and all the hopes of this kind .
However , a relief such as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called the economy in her own private expenses , she sent them frequently .
It had always been obvious to her that an income as high as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their needs , and unfeeling of the future , must have been very insufficient in their support; and every time they changed rooms , Jane or herself were sure to be asked to get some help with their bills .
Their way of life , even when the restoration of peace sent them home , was disrupted to the extreme .
They always moved from one place to another in search of a cheap situation , and always spent more than they should .
Her affection for her soon fell into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the pretensions to the reputation which her marriage had given her .
Although Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley , for Elizabeth's sake , he still helped him in his profession .
Lydia was sometimes there when her husband had gone to London or Bath to have fun; and with the Bingleys , they had both been so often so long , that even Bingley's good humor was over , and he went so far as to speak of giving them a hint of being gone .
Miss Bingley was deeply mortified by the marriage of Darcy; but as she thought it useful to retain Pemberley's right of visit , she gave up all her resentment; He loved Georgiana more than ever , almost as attentive to Darcy as in the past , and paid to Elizabeth all the delays of civility .
Pemberley was now Georgiana's house; and the sisters' attachment was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see .
They were able to love each other as well as they wanted .
Georgiana had the highest opinion in Elizabeth's world; but at first she often listened with astonishment , frightened by her way of talking to her animated and sporty brother .
He , who had always inspired a respect that almost surpassed his affection , now saw the object of the open joke .
His mind was receiving knowledge that had never fallen on him .
By Elizabeth's instructions , she began to understand that a woman can take liberties with her husband that a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself .
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant at the marriage of her nephew; and as she yielded to all the sincerity of her character in her reply to the letter announcing her arrangement , she sent him such a very abusive language , especially from Elizabeth , that for some time past all the reports had been finished .
But finally , by the persuasion of Elizabeth , he was forced to forget the offense and seek a reconciliation; and , after a little more resistance from his aunt , his resentment yielded either to his affection for him , or to his curiosity to see how his wife behaved; and she condescended to wait for them at Pemberley , notwithstanding the pollution her woods had received , not only from the presence of such a mistress , but from her uncle's and aunt's visits from the city .
With the Gardiner , they were always in the most intimate terms .
Darcy , like Elizabeth , really loved them; and they both felt the greatest gratitude to those who , by bringing him into Derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them .
